## Part 1

The post on the forum message board had been very specific, yet it had attracted a phenomenal response.

"Fifty female ticklers required for a 24 hour, $1000, tickle contest. The chance to win cash while doing your favourite thing - TICKLING! - Only experienced ticklers need apply."

Over seventy enthusiastic responses came forth, which were whittled down to the required fifty based on questions about experience, favoured tickling methods, and other queries posed by the organisers.

And so, at midday on a sunny July afternoon, the fifty would-be tickle-winners arrived as instructed at the large, secluded house in the leafy suburbs, many of them carrying "tool bags", and every single one of them, itching to get their nails to work on whichever poor thing was going to be their shot at the money!

They were all met by a young woman in her mid-twenties, standing about 5'7", with blonde, shoulder length hair, and a smiling, pretty face. "Hi there, my name's Tara", she said as she took bags and coats and directed the women into the large sitting room where their number had begun to congregate. "Please make yourselves comfortable through there, and Carol will be with you all shortly" With that, Tara handed each woman a small piece of paper with a number, and a glass of wine.

Carol was the organiser of the whole event - neither strictly a tickler or a ticklee, her love of tickling and especially f/f tickling was nevertheless enormous, and with the amount of money she had made from her numerous killings in the city, she felt that the time had come when she could truly indulge her passion. This contest was going to be her tickle nirvana.

Just after 2 p.m., she entered the sitting room, and the typewriter like chatter of anticipation amongst the women began to subside as she took up her place in the centre to address them. The women eyed her up and down; she was about 40 - but younger looking, a near perfect figure, tall, with shortish, red hair, and VERY long legs. Many of the women were hoping, indeed praying that this was the tickle victim they were going to have to break to get the money - and Carol was well aware of that feeling which gave her all the more pleasure in finally announcing the details of the contest:

"Good afternoon ladies - its wonderful to see you all. I trust you all had pleasant journeys and are ready to begin your work" A collective, excited nod rippled around the room. "As you know, you are all experienced ticklers - and I know that each of you has your favoured method, and area for tickling, which I'm sure will make for an intriguing contest. But less of this chit-chat, let me tell you the rules of our little competition: You will each be given ten minutes to tickle the victim on your own, this will continue until four of you have had a turn, then all four of you will work together as a team for another twenty minutes to try and break the ticklee. The ticklee's only breaks will be in between the hour sessions where the next group may choose her clothing (If any), and bondage position. This cycle of four ticklers an hour will repeat until the 24 hours is up, or the ticklee is broken - this may mean that some people have more turns than others, or some none at all, but the order of ticklers will be chosen at random, so I'm afraid that's just the way it is. As for the prize-money; breaking the ticklee on your own will win you the $1000, as a group of four, the money will be split; $250 each, and most importantly, if the ticklee does not crack in the 24 hrs, they will recieve the $1000, plus another $5000 from your entry fees. As you can see, there is plenty of incentive for all to try VERY hard!" A collective chuckle filled the room, and having heard the rules, the aire of excitement grew ten-fold!

`Right then ladies, before we begin, I think I should explain the one crucial difference between this contest and others you may have read about or taken part in. You see, if there's one thing I find boring, its watching so-called tickle torture where the person being tickled is a 'ticklee'. After all, being tickled is what they actually enjoy, however horrible it may be at the time. You, on the other hand are all 'ticklers' - you LOVE tickling, but you HATE being tickled. - So with that in mind, I can now tell you all that your 'ticklee' for this 24 hour marathon, is going to be ... One of you!"

Carol's rye smile was the only one left in the room - most of the women looked stunned - many horrified - one of them soon piped up, "The post said nothing about this! - You asked for only ticklers".

"And that's what you are" replied Carol calmly - "I anticipated such a reaction, and if any of you wish to leave - you may do so now - but before you do, think about this ... There are fifty of you here - the chances of any one of you being our tickle-toy are fifty to one. That means that each one of you has a 49 out of 50 chance of getting to tickle a feisty, ticklish, fellow tickler - totally unaccustomed to being on the other end - just think - at those odds - what a reward - a truly defiant, usually dominant tickle-slave. And if you are the VERY unlucky one - the chance of Â£6000, and the title of Little Miss Unbreakable!"

A roar of quiet chattering broke out between individuals and in little groups - Carol looked on - confident that the draw of the reward would be enough for the women to face the odds of selection.

"So - are we all staying?" asked Carol in a commanding tone. The silence said it all - the contest was on!

## Part 2

`Well then ladies - it looks as if it`s time to get things started and choose our ticklee. You`ve all remained seated so I take it you are all aware that should you be the unlucky lottery winner, there is no turning back!`

Again a pin-drop silence engulfed the room - another reluctant seal of approval from the now tense, excited congregation.

Tara now re-entered the room carrying a black felt bag - she stood next to Carol, still smiling pleasantly. All 50 women knew what was about to happen!

`The first number I draw from this bag will be our tickle subject for the next 24 hours - this decision is final. I do however appreciate the unpleasantness of being chosen, and so as a reward the selected woman will get to tie and tickle Tara here for an hour, while the tickling groups are established. And I can assure you ladies - she`s as ticklish as she is lovely!`

Tara wiggled slightly at the mere thought of the idea - Carol had told her it would be part of the rules - but still, as she looked out at the sea of well manicured nails, she couldn`t help but tremble at the thought of having even ten of them let loose on her, oh so sensitive flesh! The tension in the room lessened slightly as the ticklers eyed the sexy young blonde up and down - a few no doubt were almost wishing now that they were drawn from the bag - but the long term prospects of the `loser` were still bleak enough to keep most of them stoney faced.

`So here goes ladies!` Carol`s expression was like that of a child in a sweet shop as she looked at the fifty women and simultaneously delved her hand into the bag. It was quite a contrast to the pained anticipation of the rest of the room. To a one, these women were `ticklers` - they didn`t do the `being tickled` thing! No-one wanted to hear their number!

After what seemed like an eternity, Carol`s hand finally re-emerged from the bag - she brought the piece of paper close to her face, and began to unfold it. All eyes were on her lips:

`And our lucky - ahem, sorry, unlucky winner is ... Number 17`

Sighs of relief reverberated around the sitting room - followed by darting glances to try to spot the one woman who wasn`t smiling ...

And Rachel most certainly was not smiling - she wasn`t doing anything - she was just in her own little world of disbelief as she stared at her ticket. `If only I hadn`t been so greedy as to stay when I found out the `catch`` she thought. She was a controlled woman, and she knew that freaking out or trying to argue with the decision now would make her look pathetic - but the sense of panic welling up inside her was frightening. If Carol had wanted a strong willed, but hyper ticklish tickler, who HATED being tickled, then oh boy, with Rachel she`d found it - and Rachel knew it!

`Seventeen - come on now, which one of you has seventeen` Carol`s calmly spoken words suddenly brought Rachel back from her temporary daydreaming. Tentatively at first, and then with increasing conviction Rachel rasied her hand, finally uttering with all the composure she could muster; `It`s me, I`m number seventeen.` She battled to stay in control of her voice and demeanor as she had done all her life. Rachel was no-one`s fool and she wanted desperately to make her fellow ticklers believe this, right now, at the outset - but already as 49 sets of eyes glared at her, paying such cruel attention to her potential hotspots - feet, ribs, legs and underarms, with sadistic, tickler`s smiles - she knew that staying in control this time was going to be near impossible!

`Come forward dear - lets have a round of applause for our loser shall we` - Carol`s words seemed totally synical as Rachel forced herself to stand and walk to join Carol and Tara.

Carol glanced at the clipboard containing the names and details of all the gathered contestants, and anounced to the room, `This is Rachel everybody` a collective smile once again struck Rachel, it almost felt as if the women were beginning to tickle her already.

`Well, I`m very sorry for you my dear, but, you were aware of the rules!` Rachel nodded resignedly. `So I`d imagine you`d like to make a start on torturing young Tara here, while we all prepare for your - SLIGHTLY longer endurance test!`

The sarcastic emphasis of the word `slightly`, caused a ripple of laughter. Rachel had forgotten about her consolation prize of getting to tickle Carol`s lovely assistant, and as Carol began drawing the numbers for the groups that would soon be driving her crazy with one wave of ticklish agony after another, the only way Rachel could stop herself running for the door, was to totally put the future to the back of her mind and concentrate on making the next hour a living tickle hell for the beautiful blonde standing before her.

Tara gave Rachel a reassuring smile, and teasingly raised her arm above her head to reveal her deliciously smooth armpit. Without a word, she gestured Rachel to give it a tickle - as almost a reflex reaction Rachel, all her life a tickler, reached out a wiggling finger and grazed it down Tara`s underarm. Tara giggled, and swiftly brought her arm down - it was clear to Rachel that she was one TICKLISH lady! With that, and with the next hour and nothing else in mind ... for now ... Rachel followed Tara from the room, as her soon to be torturer`s laughed and conspired behind her ...

## Part 3

Rachel followed Tara up the grand spiral staircase and into the palacial bedroom, which she was informed would be the setting for their hour of tickle torture. As the door closed, the excited chattering downstairs was no longer audible, and the new found silence allowed Rachel for the first time to completely forget her upcoming ordeal and begin to genuinely enjoy her current situation.

Again she stared at the gorgeous young blonde and, anxious to waste no time asked, `So - what now?`

Tara replied with a devilish smile on her face; `For the next hour, I have to do WHATEVER you say - its really all up to you ...`. With that, Tara opened the large double closet opposite the window and sat cross legged on the edge of the enormous four poster.

Rachel`s eyes turned to the closet - it contained all manner of restraints and potential tickling equipment - feathers, brushes, pens, pencils - even sets of LONG false fingernails. Carol had thought of everything! This fact briefly reminded Rachel of the hell she would shortly be facing herself - but with one final conserted effort, she banished all such thoughts to the back of her head and walked towards the closet to inspect its contents more closely and make her first selection - Tara`s restraints ...

The choice was huge - from the lightest of silk scarves to the most stringent of leather and metal bondage equipment, as Rachel turned once more to look at her, still smiling, oh so pretty tickle toy, she decided that a more erotic tying was the order of the day, and so she picked out four, black, silk stockings from the cupboard and walked over to Tara.

`Do you want me naked?` asked the impeccably polite girl, although now with the slightest hint of trepidation ...

`No no` said Rachel, `But I think you can lose that lovely red dress of yours. Just strip to your bra, panties and heels and lie down would you - believe me I could tickle you to insanity even if you were fully clothed anyway!` The threat didn`t seem to phase Tara, as she dutifully obeyed, and reclined on the sumptuous quilt - now clad only in the most delicious black lace underwear.

`Raise your arms`, commanded Rachel as she secured Tara`s wrists to the bed post with the first two stockings. The securing of her second wrist prompted Tara to scrunch her eyes shut for a moment - she well knew that her freedom was now lost - and at any moment an attack on her sensitive armpits could take place! But Rachel was too much of a professional to leave it at that - after all, that`s why she`d actually come here, and despite everything else, she was hell bent on making this girl lose it, and Tara`s calm compliance to everything that happened to her was only making Rachel doubly determined to see her scream the house down!

Within a few seconds Tara`s spread-eagle was complete - her heel clad feet now also secured with stockings to opposite corners of the bed - which due to its size meant her legs were very widely spread.

`Comfy?` asked Rachel mockingly as she surveyed her victim. Tara nodded, somewhat uneasily.

`So you have to do whatever I tell you for the next hour - correct?` Again Tara nodded - now tugging a little nervously at her well tied restraints. Rachel smiled wickedly.

`Alright then - I want you ... to ask me ... to ... tickle your armpits!`

Tara stared blankly at her tormentor for a moment - Rachel repeated her request before she could say anything ...

`Say ... Please tickle my armpits - they`re NOT ticklish`

`But ...`

`Just say it` Rachel retorted before Tara could explain that her armpits were indeed INCREDIBLY ticklish - but of course Rachel knew this - it was just one of the things that Rachel loved to do - tickle someone who claimed not to be - and now Tara was at her command, she was going to make her say and do everything she`d always fantasised about.

`Please tickle my armpits - they`re er ... er ... not ticklish` uttered a clearly excited but panicky Tara.

`Oh aren`t they now! - Let`s just see shall we ...` Tara knew what was coming - Rachel jumped onto the bed and hitching her own business style skirt up, she straddled Tara`s toned, tanned stomach and hovered her nails over the beauties naked underarms.

`One more thing before I begin Tara` said the now totally composed Rachel, `All the time I tickle your armpits - I want you to stare right into my eyes - got that? - right at me - the WHOLE time!`

Tara had never been asked to do anything like this before in all of her many sessions with Carol - but she knew she had to obey, and fixed her gaze at the piercing green eyes of her domineering captor.

With that - Tara felt the first super light stroke of Rachels fingernails on her left underarm. One, then two then three, then four - then her whole right hand began teasing the soft flesh of her armpit - Tara`s wrist was tied so tightly that there was no way she could reduce the gaping hollow of her deadly ticklish pit as the feathery finger strokes took up effect on her other underarm as well.

All of this time Tara had been desperately fighting her natural reaction to being tickled - which was to scrunch her eyes tightly shut and throw her head back - instead she had - to her credit - maintained her fixed stare at her captors face.

Rachel hadn`t even begun yet though - her slowly moving fingernails had been deliberately weak enough not to force Tara into a real state of laughter, but just sufficient to create an unending welling up of giggles just below the surface that grew bigger with every second - it was like a perpetual state of itching, irritating, ticklish limbo. And it was her victim`s widely smiling, half grimmacing face through all of this that Rachel was delighting in - hence the request to keep firm eye contact.

`Tell me again that this doen`t tickle Tara` said Rachel, in a teasing voice.

Not realising that Rachel was only toying with her, and therefore impressed by her own ability thus far to keep from laughing out loud - Tara took a deep breath, and through a painfully wide smile spluttered her instructed line; `It ... it d-d-doesn`t t-tickle!`

Rachel`s fantasy was emerging before her very eyes - staring into them in fact. `Well then I suppose I`ll just have to try a little harder ...`

With that, Rachel`s fingers began to make more rapid, tortuously light scrabbling spirals around both Tara`s armpits - covering the delicate skin just above her bra and then into the hollow itself.

Tara could hold back no longer - she burst into howls of girlish laughter and began to pull vigorously at the stockings binding her wrists. `Oh - so little Tara has got tickly underarms then!` said a triumphant Rachel - `And only another 50 mins to go!`

She continued to torture the blonde`s gorgeous armpits - all the time making her stare into her face - the hysterical laughter turning to tears as her stomach wobbled with hiccoughy giggles. After ten minutes, Tara`s face was a picture of ticklish submission - her eyes, still open and looking at Rachel`s happy smile, but so full of tears that she could barely see. Finally Rachel relented and sat back on Tara`s hips and watched as the girl SLOWLY brought her laughter to an end.

`How was that Tara? Only 40 mins left!` Tara couldn`t speak and just lay there getting her breath back.

`Ok Tara - what I want you to do this time is ...`

On hearing this, Tara thought to herself that at least Rachel`s penchant for a script to her tickling meant that she could have a few minutes break while the next rule or whatever was established ... Rachel continued ...

`Pray you don`t die laughing!` With that abrubt statement Tara`s head shot up to look at what Rachel was about to do - Rachel produced one of the long peacock feathers she had procured from Carol`s little toy cupboard and proceded to stroke it along the LONG inner thigh of Tara`s left leg - Tara immediately began to giggle uncontrollably, along with her feet, her thighs were desperately ticklish - and she GENUINELY didn`t enjoy having this part of her body tickled. Unlike her armpit session - this time Rachel went straight for the kill using her nails and the feather together, in a tickly blur that left Tara wailing and begging for it to stop.

Rachel had never seen anyone with such horribly ticklish thighs and revelled in Tara`s reaction as she bounced around in a REAL effort to get her legs away from the delicate torment. Rachel hoped the room was soundproofed as she had no intentions of stopping her tickling of Tara`s shapely thighs for some time yet.

She continued to do so until there was only 25 minutes of her hour remaining - and she still had to tickle her favourite spot - the feet! She stopped her mad attack on the girl`s thighs - but couldn`t resist a further five minutes of keeping Tara giggling and begging by VERY gently scraping all ten nails, all the way up to her underwear, and then all the way down to her knees, along the soft skin of her inner thighs. This was like the first few minutes again - Tara not actually laughing, but instead looking like she was in pain at the maddening, irritating sensation engulfing her hips and legs.

`Well my dear, you`ll be pleased to know you only have 20 minutes of your ordeal left to endure` said Rachel, leaving the bed and circling it for a moment as she observed her beautiful slave. Tara was now a sweaty mess - a million miles from the pretty, alluring, perfect looking assistant that had greeted her a couple of hours previously.

`I want you to guess where I`m going to tickle you now ...`

Tara took a moment, but knew what the answer was - and knew she had to say it ...

`My ... my f-feet`

`That`s right honey - how did you guess!` Rachel laughed at this, after all it was pretty obvious.

With that she walked up behind Tara and propped her head and shoulders up with a pillow from the end of the bed - she wanted her to watch her helpless feet being punished!

`Right then` Rachel now looked ready for her final assault on her lovely tickle-toy - she went to the closet and fixed on a set of evil looking, long, red nails and walked back over to the bed.

`You won`t be needing these now I don`t think` she said as she slowly slipped off, first one, then the other of Tara`s black heels from her feet. And what feet they were - red nail polish - super high arches and wrinkled soles which couldn`t have been softer if she tried!

`I see why Carol holds you in such high esteem` said Rachel with a smirk as she rubbed Tara`s nude right foot with her hand.

`Ok Tara - I`m going to tickle you now till they come in here to get me - no breaks - NO MERCY!` Tara gulped slightly and wiggled her feet like crazy at the mere prospect.

`This time, I again want you look right into my eyes while I do this to you - but I also want you to keep your toes PERFECTLY still - you may move your feet as much as your bonds will allow - but your toes must not flex - do you understand?`

Tara looked aghast - `Yes - but I don`t ... er I can`t, ... you see my feet are too ticklish!`

Rachel looked unsurprised ... `Fine - but be warned - all the time that your toes are not still - I will use this feather between your toes until you stop moving them again - OK?`

What a stupid question - of course it wasn`t okay - but Tara had no choice, and wiping tears from her face on her shoulder, she nodded a response.

Rachel took one final look at her watch - `Twenty minutes to see how much you can take Tara dear - here goes` ...

Rachel`s nails went to work slowly at first - wanting to allow Tara at least the slightest chance of keeping her toes from curling - she watched the blondes face intently as once again it stared back at her - laughing like crazy already. Unlike with her underarms - the gentle teasing nail strokes on her soles were plenty to drive her wild from the start - her feet, infact, were ten times as ticklish as her pits.

Ten whole minutes passed and Tara`s sole torment seemed unending as Rachel used each long, probing nail to dance over every inch of the girls bound, bare feet. Eventually, as Tara`s expression screamed the question -`Why are you doing this to me?` - her battle to keep her toes from flexing was lost - and their futile wiggling began - in a fruitless attempt to lessen the sensations besieging her feet.

Rachel took a moment to notice this as she was lost in heaven watching Tara`s pretty, sweaty, tearful gaze trying to endure the unbearable tickling. But then she felt one of her captive`s toes touch her hand as it wriggled.

`Oh dear - naughty girl!` she mocked, `You know you were supposd to do EVERYTHING I said. Well you know the deal - until you make them still again, its the feather ...` Immediately a long peacock plume was plunged between the second and third toes of each of Tara`s feet - whose eyes nearly jumped out of her head at this fresh sensation. Back and forth the feathers sawed - switching toes from time to time. Tara was again sobbing and her laughter had become silent, but still she stared at her tormentor - and somehow, finally, fighting all natural reactions - she managed to stop her toes squirming until they stopped altogether.

`My my - aren`t we a fighter` - remarked Rachel, genuinely impressed with Tara`s defiance. `Unfortunately for you, all that means is that you suffer more foot tickling from my scratchy, tickly nails here ... and you`ve still got another ...`. Rachel glanced at her watch, as the broken Tara hung her head in resigned submission - but then Rachel`s face too dropped. It was 3:30 - her time was up! - She knew it, but didn`t want to believe it - she had been so lost in a world of tickling fantasy with Tara that she hadn`t realised how long the blonde had held out for. She wasn`t going to stop now - this wasn`t fair she thought, and turned back to begin tickling again. But just then there was a knock at the door ... Carol`s distinctive voice broke the silence of the room - `Rachel my dear ...

...its time!`

## Part 4

The large wooden door of the bedroom swung open to reveal the slender figure of Carol, standing, hands on hips on the landing.

Rachel was still on her knees at the end of the bed, from where she had tormented Tara`s SUPER ticklish feet for the past twenty minutes - the blonde herself was now lying, eyes closed, slowly recovering from her ordeal - safe in the knowledge that Carol had arrived to take Rachel away for her own taste of tickle torture!

Rachel glanced back at the pair of wrinkled soles in front of her and sighed at the two confilcting thoughts, bouncing around in her head - One; just how badly she wanted to continue tickling the lovely Tara, and how much more she had up her sleeve with which to drive the gorgeous young thing out of her mind - and two; the fact that it was soon to be her own delicate feet that would be subjected to an almost inconceivable length of tickle endurance.

`Rachel my dear`, Carol repeated, `We`re ready for you across the hall`, Rachel slowly rose to her feet and adjusted her slightly ruffled clothing.

`May I congratulate you on your very professional work on young Tara here` Carol continued as she strode over to the bed and gave the still helpless Tara a quick, playful armpit tickle with her long fingernail. Tara flinched slightly and moaned - still in a daze after her hour of purgatory.

`I must say, I particularly enjoyed your insistance that she maintained eye-contact with you throughout`, said the red-head as she gently wiped away some of Tara`s mascara stained tears.

`How did you know about ...` Rachel began to enquire - `Oh I watched it all on video`, replied a self assured Carol, as she gestured to a small camera in the top corner of the room, pointing directly at the bed.

`And I must say, your efforts on her thighs were truly inspired - I don`t think I`ve ever managed to make her pull at the restraints like that before - I must concentrate more there in the furure.`

Rachel was becoming more and more disturbed at the truly obsessive nature with which Carol clearly regarded her tickling - video cameras, critcial appraisals of her `work` - it all pointed to her own test - the 24 hour marathon for which the fifty women had actually come - being a day of absolute, unadulterated hell!

`But look - we`re running late` said Carol, pointing at the grandfather clock which showed the time to be 3:45 - `Its almost time for us to begin out contest - and the first group of ladies is waiting to get you set up - follow me`

Carol turned to leave the room, and with an almighty lump in her throat, a trembling Rachel followed - as she closed the door behind her, she took one last look at the now sleeping Tara - still bound and clearly exhausted - could she herself endure a similar fate? - she didn`t know - she didn`t want to know - but she was about to find out ...

## Part 5

This was it for Rachel!

She followed Carol down the corridor - her heart thumping like a train piston. This was most definitely not what she had envisaged when she had eagerly replied to Carol`s tickler tempting internet post. For Rachel was, and always had been, an out and out control freak, and here she was, about to surrender all control for 24 hours to an army of women with the same mindset as her`s - all intent on reducing her to a weeping, begging, ticklish mess.

As they approached the door to what Rachel assumed would be her effective torture chamber until the same time the next day, she tried to focus one last time, she galvanised her thoughts. `I`m NOT going to be broken!` she thought to herself defiantly. However little she may have believed it, she was going to give it everything she had - She was going to show the world what a tough bitch she was - No cracking! - No begging! - and, if humanly possible, - No laughing! She realised the latter, if not all of her aims were near impossible - but she had to think like that - she hadn`t spent her whole life maintaining an icy, unflappable facade to have it shattered now - she was going to beat these women! - she was going to take the jackpot!

Carol opened the door. It was yet another plush bedroom - even larger than before, but this time - not only was there a grand four poster - but a rack style wooden table, an x-frame, and numerous chains, cuffs and shackles hanging from the ceiling and walls. Seated on the bed were the first group of ticklers. Carol proceeded to carry out some brief introductions ...

`Right then ladies - you all know Rachel ...`, the four women nodded and smiled at Rachel, making her feel even more queasy - torturers with smiles!

`Rachel, this is Elaine, Sarah, Jo, and Mary`, explained Carol as she pointed to each woman in turn - `They will be tickling you, in that order, for ten minutes each, then all four will tickle you for the remaining twenty minutes. You`ll get the hang of it by the 24th group!!!` chuckled Carol in a distinctly sinister manner. The women laughed too - each hoping of course that it wouldn`t get to that stage and that one of them would get Rachel to break on their turn, and win the money!

`Well its almost four o` clock, so I`ll leave you five to get yourselves sorted - I`ll be watching the C.C.T.V. camera and acting as referee. But before I go, I just need to tell you a couple of vital things Rachel ...`

Carol turned to address Rachel alone; `Each group will decide at the start of their seesion, what you will wear, and how you will be tied for that hour. You must comply. After that you must do - or try to do everything you are told - if you fail to make any effort to obey, or are in ANY way nasty to your ticklers, that is to say, more than the occasional curse - this will be taken by me as a default submission and you will lose - AND have to endure the remaining time of the 24 hours!`

Rachel looked slightly shocked - but understood clearly. She would have hoped for just such stringent rules if she had been lucky enough to be one of the ticklers herself. `Other than that, you will recieve a toilet and food/drink break every four hours, and be allowed a five minute break in between hour sessions. These breaks will obviously be added to the total time of 24 hours! And of course - the most important thing you`ll be wanting to know my dear - the word you need to scream to submit and concede that you have been broken ... its simple enough ... MERCY!`

`Any questions?` asked a grinning Carol. Rachel looked expressionless, like a child at a school assembly. Although her mind was racing, trying to put into words all the questions she had - she couldn`t - all she could do was stare back blankly.

`Right then ladies - she`s all yours! ... Good luck my dear!` Carol s******ed. With that, the red-headed organiser of this diabolical event, turned and left the room, sweeping the solid oak doors behind her - Rachel heard the lock click shut as a voice startled her ... it was Elaine.

`We just all wanted you to know how much we sympathise with you at being chosen for this thing Rachel. The four of us have been talking, and we all said, as ticklers, how much we dreaded being picked ourselves - it must be a nightmare for you.`

Not quite sure how to respond to what seemed a very genuine sentiment, at a very perculiar time, Rachel managed only a cursory `Thanks` and then returned to silence.

`But`, piped up Jo ... `Its time to go lady! - Shall I tell her how we want her girls?` Jo was clearly the cockiest member of the group - About 19 years old, shortish with dyed black hair - she was a typical grunge chick - dressed all in black, with laddered black tights and a pierced navel. Not to mention almost eternally long false nails!

`Go ahead`, replied Mary. Mary was quite the opposite of the brash, loud-mouthed Jo. Around 45, she was conservatively dressed in white blouse and brown slack pants. Her hair was daintily coiffured, and her whole demeanor seemed that of the average suburban housewife. Unlike Jo, Rachel couldn`t imagine Mary wanting to tickle-torture anyone. She was soon to find out if her imagination was accurate or not.

`Ok then Rach - we want you over there, under that ceiling hook` demanded Jo - like a spoilt little brat. - Oh and lose the blouse lady!`

Despite Jo`s obnoxious tone, Rachel obeyed without a word - she had long ago put aside any thoughts of protest, she was here to endure the ultimate tickle test after all. She unbuttoned her blouse and slipped it off - Mary smiling kindly, took it from her and placed it on the bed.

`Arms up!` instructed Jo abrubtly - the others seemingly happy to let the youngest girl run the show for now. Again, Rachel complied

Then, up stepped Sarah, and, being taller than the diminutive Jo, reached up and secured Rachels wrists firmly to the dangling leather cuffs.

As she did so, she stood facing the now helpless Rachel, who for the first time took notice of this so-far anonymous member of the group. She noticed that she bore a close resemblance to Elaine - medium build, straight blonde hair, and unremarkable blue eyes - sort of, average looking really. - They were both about 30 she guessed. Then it clicked - they were sisters! She almost thought of enquiring if this was indeed the case, as she may have done to make polite conversation at one of her many business lunches, but as she stared up at her tightly restrained wrists, she knew this setting was altogether different. A glance at the clock also reminded her that nothing trivial mattered now - It was four `o clock - This was crunch time! - NO TURNING BACK!

The four women stood back for a second to admire their bound subject. Rachel stood the tallest of all of them - around 6 ` they reckoned. A brunette with a serious, yet alluring face - she wasn`t pretty in the way Tara was - but kinda sexy. She wasn`t skinny despite her height, but neither was she too curvy or chubby - just a tall, well proportioned, almost amazon looking businesswoman. They drank in the picture of her helplessness, arms stretched high above her - not quite on tip-toes, but her calves taught, straining for balance. Despite still being clad in her bra, business skirt, nylons and heels, the acres of bare, creamy flesh of her exposed torso - her sides, armpits and stomach, were plenty for this group of predominantly upper body ticklers to go to work on. And they were about to begin ...

A buzzer sounded. Presumably operated remotely by Carol. - Game on!

Elaine, who`s turn it was first, stood up to begin her assault.

`Ticklish Rachel?` Elaine asked teasingly as she held her fingers, claw like in front of Rachel`s face. Rachel said nothing - she knew she was ticklish - VERY VERY ticklish, but being a tickler, she realised that saying `no` would only fuel the contestants determination to prove her wrong. Nevertheless she just couldn`t bring herself to admit that she was - to confess to anyone that she had such a human, almost childish weakness made her feel sick, she hated appearing vulnerable, and so a silent response it was to be!

`Lets see then shall we ...` Rachel looked one last time at the other three women, as they sat, spread around the room, enthralled by her impending torture - their faces lit up like christmas trees. Elaine moved forward and began to gently scratch her nails over the soft skin of Rachel`s neck. Rachel flinched and winced immediately. Elaine`s nails proceeded to stray all over her neck, shoulders and around the back of her ears. Rachel hadn`t expected to be tickled in this way - it was HORRIBLE! - she tensed her neck and shoulders and tried desperately to pull her head away from the electric like itching sensation.

`Cootchie cootchi coo`, exclaimed a clearly happy Elaine, as she continued titilating Rachel`s neck with one hand and began tickling her cheek with the other.

`Grrrmmmmmph` Rachel`s face became a portrait of irritaion as this, somewhat bizarre torment continued. `At least it isn`t making me laugh` Rachel thought in an effort to boost her morale - but a second, frightening thought followed immediately - `If I`m this ticklish on my face ... OMG ...!!!`

`Aww - I think I`m annoying Rachel here - am I Rachel?` - again Elaine`s teasing question went unanswered as the brunette tried desperately to maintain some composure.

`Ooh, five minutes gone` said Elaine looking at the clock - `I think I`m going to need one of those lovely ostrich feathers over there`. At hearing this, Sarah rose from her vantage point on the bed and passed a long, fluffy ostrich plume over to Elaine, in a move that almost seemed rehearsed.

`Thanks Sis` said Elaine, taking the feather. Elaine quickly returned to her work ...

If the fingers had been irritating to Rachel, what was to happen now nearly drove her out of her skin! Elaine sweeped and swooped the feather across the same parts of Rachel`s now sensitised neck with a devilishly light touch - Rachel was convinced that she would pull a muscle if she had to tense any more. And luckily for her, a few minutes later Elaine stopped. Rachel assumed that she had survived her first tickler, and sighed in relief as she was finally able to loosen up a little. But a glance to the side made her aware that there were two minutes of Elaine`s turn left.

`C`mon then Rachel, - you know the word - Mercy! - I think you`ll wanna say it soon!` Mocked the blonde. With that, Elaine took the feather and began stippling it, very delicately around Rachel`s nostrils - Rachel went crazy - she ducked and craned her head - coughed, spluttered - did everthing she could within her bondage to get her nose away from Elaine`s tickly feather. Then she felt the inevitable sneeze building - her eyes narrowed and she took a deep breath.

Sensing this, Elaine went for the kill, directing the feather right up both Rachel`s, now flaring, nostrils - Rachel continued to fight the building sneeze - again - she wanted to give this woman NO satisaction at all. But it was unavoidable - the tingling in her nose was simply too much and she exploded into a barrage of sneezes.

As Rachel eventually brought her sneezing to an end, she opened her watery eyes to find Elaine gone ... Her sneezing had masked the sound of Carol`s game show buzzer. The ten minutes were up!

Rachel took a refreshing breath as she realised that she had, at least so far, achieved her aim - one tickler down and not a giggle, cry or plead in sight. For a brief moment she felt good. Strong and sure of herself, just as she`d always been. But as Sarah strode into view, there was to be no respite ... it was time for big Sister to try her skills!

## Part 6

`Finished sneezing now Honey?` asked Sarah tauntingly, as she moved in for her assault on the still bound, watery-eyed Rachel.

`I apologise for my little sister by the way - that nose tickling thing of hers! - annoying as hell isn`t it!?` It seemed as if Sarah had also been on the receiving end of Elaine`s abominable nostril teasing herself in the past. `Don`t worry though Rachel - I`m gonna give you a PROPER tickling now!`

The glint in Sarah`s eye convinced Rachel that this was no empty promise and she soon felt the first probing tweaks and pinches of her sides beginning.

`I`m gonna see just how ticklish you are Honey ...` Sarah stared intently at Rachel`s face as she continued the exploration of her victim`s sides and stomach. She searched tirelessly for that giveaway twitch, the sharp intake of breath, the squirm, the wiggle of the hips - whatever the tell-tale sign was, that told her she had found the spot or technique that got to Rachel.

Although this wasn`t truly tortuous tickling - not the kind that Rachel herself revelled in dishing out, in the way she had done when tormenting Tara`s thighs and feet - it was, nevertheless, that sort of playground rib poking, side grabbing, finger kneading manipulation that, when applied to the slightly flabby part of the midriff, was almost impossible not to react to. And forcing the towering, seemingly icy brunette to react was Sarah`s only true aim for her brief, ten minute session.

Sarah and Elaine had realised, when they were drawn as the first two numbers from the bag, that the chances of breaking anyone in the first twenty minutes of a 24 hour marathon would be very slim. Especially bearing in mind the cash at stake and the probable determination of their subject. So, they had agreed that they would be best served by both `softening` Rachel up a little on their respective turns - sensitising her, making her gradually more ticklish and weaker from trying to hold everything in - and then, with Rachel more responsive but still unprepared for a multi-handed attack, going all out for the kill in their twenty minute, final onslaught with the other two women.

The sign that Sarah had been looking for didn`t take long to materialise - it was a bite of the lip - `Such a classic!`, Sarah thought as she continued with the method that had provoked the first real reaction from the so-far statue like Rachel.

`I got ya` now babe!` exclaimed Sarah as both her hands rapidly squeezed and released Rachel`s soft sides just above the waistband of her skirt.

The smile on Rachel`s face grew wider and wider as her lip biting became less and less effective against her building urge to giggle ... `I can take this! - I CAN take this!` thought Rachel, over and over in her head, in a desperate attempt to keep herself from breeching her self-imposed `No laughing` clause.

`You CAN`T take this for another 6 minutes, now can you Rachel!?`. Sarah`s words contradicted Rachel`s own thoughts and reminded her of the truth - she couldn`t! - at least not without laughing! The feeling inside her was one she hadn`t experienced since her early teens, when the other girls at school would wriggle their fingers into her sides in class, or in the dead silence of the library, as she fought in vain to keep a smile from her face and the giggles from emerging. It was like a gas cylinder waiting to be released!

`Keep at her!` prompted an excited Elaine from the edge of the room - also sensing that the current side assault was wearing down Rachel`s resistance.

Sarah`s fingers were relentless. `Cootchie coo!` beckoned Sarah. How Rachel hated that phrase. Another reminder of the childhood weakness she`d strived so hard to banish. Memories of aunts coming to the house and doing the exact same thing, until they managed to transform her usually scowling, spoilt-child attitude into one of helpless hysterics.

`C`MON Sarah - you gotta get her - 1 minute to go!` Again Elaine shouted encouragement to her older sibling, this time with real urgency, as it seemed that once again the strong-willed Rachel may be about to survive the 10 minutes without being forced into an audible giggle.

Not realising how little time she had left - like her sister, enjoying too much Rachel`s struggles to stay silent - Sarah quickly intensified her movements - now sliding her hands a little lower, right to the point just above Rachel`s hips, where her skirt met the vulnerable flesh.

Rachel`s eyes now closed tightly, and her breathing became incredibly short as her lungs hopped and skipped, trying to release the bellyful of laughs that were still growing and growing. Her teeth bit her bottom lip so hard that she nearly drew blood - she was hanging on for dear life - GOD - it tickled so much!

Rachel inhaled deeply - and she knew that as Sarah`s hands continued to writhe around her lower sides, the returning breath would surely bring an almighty laugh - she just coudn`t hold back a second longer!

Bzzzzzzzzz!

She didn`t have to - The ten minute buzzer sounded - and, luckily for Rachel, a clearly disappointed Sarah dropped her hands away immediately - disgusted with herself for being so gentle on Rachel early on.

Rachel held her breath for a few seconds more, not daring to open her mouth until the massive, fluctuating giggle inside her had finally surpressed itself.

`Talk about saved by the bell, bitch!` Rachel craned her head to see where this somewhat aggressive comment had come from - no surprise - it was the wholly objectionable Jo.

The supremely arrogant, gum chewing, semi-goth, got up from the set of stocks on which she had been perched for the duration of Sarah`s little playtime. She walked up to Rachel and, straining immensely on the toes of her heavy looking black boots, tried to stare Rachel out, face to face at eye level.

Rachel couldn`t help but find this funny. Sure, out of all the women in the room, Jo was the only one who she had developed a true disliking of - but the way in which the almost dwarfish young girl tried to psyche her out - a six footer - still wearing her heels - and tied to the ceiling for god`s sake! The sheer height difference was a little comical!

`You`ve had it WAY too easy so far lady! - I`m gonna have you squealing like a baby inside a minute!` boasted the petite tickler.

This bravado was expected, and Rachel`s achievement of having lasted 20 mins now without even giggling, certainly made her feel more confident at the prospects ahead. But equally, she knew that Jo was going to show NO mercy on her tightly stretched torso. This little miss wanted the money bad! She was here to win and nothing else. This gave Rachel all the more incentive to try and repel her attack. This was one girl she REALLY didn`t want to give the satisfaction of cracking to!

Bzzzzzzzzz!

`You gotta do what I say - remember lady?` Jo prompted as the buzzer sounded that her time had begun. Rachel nodded.

`Well I want you to tell me what you do for a living - ya look kinda uptight - like you`re a lawyer or somethin` - so what is it bitch!?

Rachel hadn`t expected Jo to start of with `relative` pleasantries - but any of the time taken up with talking suited her. She knew the rules meant that she had to answer ...

`No, I`m not a lawyer, I work in marketing - I`m a consul.... aahhh.!`

As she spoke, Jo began scrabbling her black nails frantically in Rachel`s right armpit.

`Whatsamatta bitch? - I asked ya a question and you stopped half way through!`

Jo continued to tickle Rachel`s cruelly ticklish underarm. This was the first REAL tickling she had tasted - and the battle not to laugh this time, was lost almost before it was begun.

`I`m waiting lady - talk to me!` Jo`s tone was typically aggressive, but her nails danced a delicate ballet over the skin of Rachel`s armpit - she introduced her other hand to the left pit and began investigating it`s prone hollow.

`Tell me what you do!` demanded Jo - knowing that Rachel`s silence was another effort not to laugh - which was already beginning to fail as a stifled giggle and grunt spilled from her lips. Rachel knew she had to answer the question - wary that if Carol was watching on camera and she disobeyed this cocky little imp, she would lose automatically. She went to finish her reply - eyes TIGHTLY shut ...

`I`m a a- a- ha - c -con -consultant aaaahhahhaaaaahhh oh haahaaaaah`

Rachel had gone! Finally her worst nightmare had come true - Her ticklishness had forced her into hysterics at the hands of her teenage interrogator.

`I thought these pits of yours would be ticklish lady - you executive types are all the same - act tough - ticklish as babies! C`mon now - beg me to stop!`

Unlike the with the other women, time was not on Rachel`s side - not that she could tell in her state of laughter and discomfort. There were still 8 minutes of the ten to go. But how could she possibly withstand such a torture, she thought to herself as her laughter became more and more high pitched. After all - she may have an iron will, and a strong mind - but she was a VERY ticklish woman, her underarms being one of her very worst spots - and here they were desperatley exposed, with no hope of protection!

Rachel tried in vain to pull her arms down - even trying to pull her own feet off the ground in an effort to ease her suffering. Her armpits felt like they were home to a hundred dancing spiders and her helplessness to prevent it was driving her up the wall!

`C`mon missy-big-shot consultant! - beg for me to stop - say mercy - ya know how much you hate this - you can`t stand it can you!?`

Not knowing how long she had left to endure, and being mercilessly tickled properly for the first time, Rachel`s gut reaction was to do exactly that, and end the maddening feelings in her armpits. But no way was she gonna beg to this low-life. Somehow that prospect seemed worse, even at this moment, than enduring what she knew, must only now be another five minutes of tickling at most.

That said, Rachel would have looked away in shame only a few hours before if she could see herself now.

Her stature still impressive due to her height, and with most of her clothing still intact, a certain, classiness was maintained, even if her bra was exposed. But Jo`s merciless tickling had reduced her, not only to now almost screaming shrieks of laughter, but to pulling wildly at her wrist cuffs, so much so that her muscles were clearly defined. She squirmed and rocked on her heels trying to avoid Jo`s knowing fingers, occasionally almost toppling from them, so vigorous were her endeavours.

`Admit it bitch - you`re TOO ticklish - say mercy and make it easy on yourself!`

Rachel couldn`t have known - but Jo`s demand was loaded with frustration, as her time tickling her `bitch` - was now also drawing to a close. All Rachel could do was endure her torture.

`N-N-N-NEVER!` - it may have sounded melodramatic to anyone else - but to Rachel, she truly was being tortured, and if there was anyway she could survive the awful tickling of her underarms, she was gonna stick this out till the end!

Rachel`s stomach wobbled, as her chest heaved for more air - she stamped her left heel on the floor like an out of control flamenco dancer. Her eyes alternated between being closed, looking upward, or streaming tears of ticklishness. Jo`s light, scratchy nails were incessant in pursuit of Rachel`s submission ... then just when Rachel thought she might actually pass out ...

Bzzzzzzzzz!

`Saved!` thought the exhausted Rachel.

But Jo carried on.

`SAY IT MISSY! SAY `MERCY`!` Knowing she would surely be stopped at any second by one of the other women, Jo made one last, flailing attempt at getting Rachel to crack. She tickled her entire upper body - her stomach, sides, armpits - even wiggling a finger in a her belly button - all in a 20 second whirwind of scrabbling fingers - `SAY IT!!!`.

Even if she had wanted to - Rachel was too breathless to utter anything right now. Finally, Elaine stepped up and grabbed Jo`s arms, calmly, but firmly making her stop.

Rachel slumped, as much as her bound arms would allow and simply grinned at her gothic tormentor - she`d won! And through her tears, and aching lungs, she took pleasure in knowing, that despite being humiliated in her own stringent terms of icyness - she`d not been broken!

`You wait till my next turn Rach. - I know yours spots now - You`re gonna get it good!` Raged a clearly rattled Jo.

`I`m sorry about that dear`, said Mary as Jo was taken to sit down again, still seething at Rachel`s stubborness.

Rachel looked up at the older woman`s kind face. From the outset, Mary had seemed to Rachel to be a very strange type to be a sadistic tickler - and now as Mary took a hankerchief from her trouser pocket and mopped Rachel`s sweaty brow - Rachel found herself warming even more to the attractive 40 something.

Bzzzzzzzzz!

`Oh dear - You realise what that means don`t you Rachel? If it was left up to me, I`d let you have a break before my turn, but ... those are the rules I guess.`

`Now lets see ...`

Before Rachel had truly come round from Jo`s titanic assault, and while she was still trying to establish her next tickler`s personality - Mary had produced another of Carol`s little accessories - a blindfold - and placed it over Rachel`s eyes.

It would be the last time she would see OR hear Mary for the next ten minutes.

While Elaine, Sarah and particularly Jo, had enjoyed teasing and taunting Rachel, Mary it seemed, was a real fan of subtlety and mind games.

No sooner was the blindfold in place than Rachel felt the light graze of a feather down her long, exposed side - in one drawn out stroke - from her armpit, right down to her hip - then another plume on the other side, doing the same thing, but upwards.

Next a skilled set of fingers tickled the small of her back of all places - this new senstaion nearly made Rachel jump ten feet! Then another feather - this time wiggled in her unaccustomed bellybutton. Again, the variation and freshness of the sensations were mind-blowing.

Through all of this, Rachel hadn`t been screaming hysterically, like the outright armpit tickling had induced - but continually gasping, and shrieking, as each, new, amplified feeling hit her skin. The blindfold was infuriating! She had no idea what was coming next - or more importantly where it was going to strike! Would it be a feather? Fingers? Was it even Mary tickling her - without a voice to hear she didn`t know.

To Rachel`s surprise - her ability to breathe relatively easily, and at least maintain some decorum - both a major problem at the hands of Jo - made for little comfort as this new brand of totrure was equally, if not more effective. She was wearing down fast - and just wanted this infuriating teasing to stop!

Yet another gasp shot through Rachel`s body as this time a feather probed into her much totrured armpit, while five razor-like nails circled her stomach and navel. She felt as if she had been giggling and gasping for a century at Mary`s ingenious touch - but instead it was more like five minutes.

Then her first recognisable sound for an age ... a whirring ... she knew what it was immediately - and swallowed hard! An electric toothbrush! Mary`s clever use of the blinfold meant that Rachel`s own mind was now working against her. The anticpation was easily enough to make her want this ordeal to stop. She had no idea where Mary was intending to use its fiendish bristles - all that Rachel could think repeatedly was - `Not my pits, not my pits!`

The psychological torture was immense - to add to Rachel`s confusion, another feather hit her unsuspecting stomach and began its merry dance in swirling circles, while a hand - (Presumably Mary`s), unfastened, and then let drop Rachel`s bra.

All this time - that evil whirring continued - driving Rachel insane with dread. The embarrasment of having her breasts bared didn`t even truly register, as Rachel fought through her continued giggling to hear WHERE that damned toothbrush was - and where it was GOING!

Finally as ten, lightly stoked fingernails slid slowly and smoothly, up and down her, now naked torso - tickling an armpit hollow here - teasing the sides of her breasts there - and generally itching like there was no tomorrow, causing Rachel to shiver almost constantly - the whirring stopped and Mary`s voice finally spoke once more as the buzzer again sounded ...

`Sorry about that dear - hope it wasn`t too bad. I know what the SOUND of a toothbrush can do to someone who`s blindfolded. I couldn`t be so evil as to actually use it on you! My husband once did that to me - we`re divorced now!` Mary chuckled.

As she removed the felt blindfold, again Rachel saw her kindly face - Mary really wasn`t a cruel tickler, and Rachel felt grateful that she had been so merciful as to spare her the actual use of the toothbrush, which she was sure would have brought an early end to her marathon of defiance, and had her screaming `MERCY` within minutes. Yet Mary was an ingenious and delicate tickler, who Rachel was glad to be done with - at least for now.

For she hadn`t forgotten that the true test of this first hour started now - when all four women were allowed to work toghether to break her ... Rachel physically trembled at the notion.

As Mary turned to join the other four women, she whispered one last thing in Rachel`s ear.

`Well done my dear - and good luck - I hope you make it!`

With that, Rachel looked towards the line of all four women - each obviously eager for their second shot at the prize ... Could she even make it to the second hour? At this point she couldn`t comprehend their being a possible 23 repetitions of this unbearable format. But all she could do was survive a session at a time ... and this was the culmination of her first ...

Bzzzzzzzzz!

## Part 7

Rachel took a long, deep breath as her first quartet of torturers stepped forward to begin their eight handed, 20 minute assault on her helpless frame. The events of the past hour flashed before her as she looked down at her naked upper-body and was struck by the reality of her transformation from icy, unflappable, marketing consultant, to sweating, jittery, tickle-slave. Her desire to remain straightfaced and silent had long since been shattered. She had been made to jump, yelp, giggle, shiver and scream like a schoolgirl at the varying methods of stimulation forced upon her, but, she thought - They still haven`t broken me!

Indeed, in a perverse way - despite her absolute hatred of being tickled, and her 100% tickler mentality, Rachel was somehow beginning to enjoy the challenge that lay before her ... the tickling itself was unbearable, but that was the point! - Since her late teens, she had NEVER allowed herself to be tickled - let alone tied and tickle-tortured. She knew how excrutiatingly ticklish she was and didn`t want to let her cool facade be tested. But now that this godawful contest and her own desire to tickle others had forced her to take the first step of submission, she saw that she could still be tough, and to some degree controlled, by enduring her torture and defying her own body`s weaknesses. By not giving in to her natural ticklish reactions to scream for her torment to stop, she was in fact proving herself far stronger than she had ever done by tickling someone else to that same state of tearful submission.

And it was with this new found determination that Rachel adjusted her almost tip-toed stance, and firmly grasped her wrist restraints, to make herself look as statuesque and invincible as her position would allow, in preparation for her final test of this first hour. Her defiant stare was soon met by that of her least favourite member of the group - the impish Jo.

`Now you`ve had it Rach! - All four of us at once hey! - Think you can take that!?` Jo mocked, `But don`t you worry bitch - we all know whose tickling is gonna make the big-shot crack don`t we? ... Mine!` With that, and as Elaine, Sarah and Mary took up places at Rachel`s sides and rear with various feathers and brushes, Jo`s inch-long black fingernails moved in for the second time on Rachel`s prone underarms.

Jo just LOVED tickling armpits, and Rachel had already had ten minutes first hand experience to bear this out. Rachel knew that if any of the four were going to be the `tickle too far` that finally broke down her resistance - it would almost certainly be Jo, but this also made Rachel feel sick! Of the four women, Jo was the only one she truly despised - since she first opened her cocky, teenage, goth mouth, Rachel couldn`t stand her. But much though she hated to admit it, she was also the only one of the four whose tickling REALLY got to her. Sure, the others had been irritating, tickly, and in Mary`s case intensely hard to adjust to - but Jo did the business - and boy, did it tickle! Jo`s threat that it would be her devilish fingertips that made Rachel lose it, and not whatever the three other women were simultaneously dishing out, was one that Rachel both wanted to prove wrong - but feared to be true!

`C`mon Rach - tell me I`m the best armpit tickler there is ... ha ha ha ...` Jo wasted no time as she began her infuriating finger scrabbling on BOTH Rachel`s stretched out underarms. Rachel`s eyes were already scrunched shut as she tried to block out the electric like sensation, but just as Jo claimed - she was too damn good!

Unlike the first time, Rachel almost immediately burst into loud, unrestrained laughter - and just as she had feared, it was indeed Jo`s expert tickles, that she could feel above everything else. The teasing of the other three women, whatever they were doing, at her sides and from behind her, faded into the overall sensation that every nerve-ending in her body was being wickedly stimulated by a hundred feathers.

What Elaine, Sarah and Mary were doing however, was preventing Rachel from being able to concentrate fully on withstanding the real tickling that Jo was applying to her now, slightly sweaty, armpits. The two sisters were either side of Rachel - rythymically kneading the weak spot just above her hips, around the waistline of her skirt that Sarah had discovered earlier. Although Rachel didn`t even realise she was doing it, this was making her dance around, hopping from one foot to the other in a desperate attempt to maintain balance on her business-like heels - much to the amusement of the two siblings. Mary on the other hand, was standing behind the towering, yet wobbling brunette and was using unbearably light strokes with two short, stiff feathers, to graze along the sides and underneath of Rachels firm, proportioned breasts.

Singularly, these methods would certainly have been enough to make Rachel jump out of her skin with ticklishness - but when put alongside the intensity and skillfullnss of Jo`s torture of her underarms, they simply added to her inability to fight the teenager`s efforts for tickling glory.

`Fifteen minutes to go big-shot! - Tickles BAD don`t it!? - C`mon lady - Mercy - just say it why don`t ya ...`

Rachel wanted to reply - so that she could tell this evil little bitch that she`d never give in to her - but the truth was, right now she was so breathless that she couldn`t. Her wrists felt as if they were on fire, as her reflexes, time and again forced her to yank the leather cuffs in a desperate attempt to pull down her aching arms and protect the soft skin from Jo`s dancing digits. Her feeling of helplessness was immense.

`I nearly got her gals!` announced Jo to her team-mates as they each continued their own maddening methods on the city-slicker`s nude torso.

Jo once again stared Rachel right in the face, and beamed a huge grin as she saw the signs that her victim was nearing breaking point.

`Ten minutes still to go loser! What`s that you wanna say to me - c`mon - you can tell me ...` Jo momentarily lessened the intensity of her tickling as she craned her head towards Rachel`s mouth, so that she could here what she expected to be a submission ...

Rachel, who was visibly able to regain SOME composure as Jo`s tickling diminished, leaned forward, and through tightly clenched teeth, with her chest still heaving from the involuntary giggles welling in her stomach from the other womens` actions - managed a stifled, half whisper ... `Y-You`d b-better k-k-eep t-trying ... l-l-loser!!!`.

Rachel`s satisfaction was clear - she leaned her head back and smiled broadly with satisfaction, the huge grin induced partly by the continued tickling, and partly by the look on Jo`s face.

`Oh - you reckon that`s funny huh lady!?` Scowled a raging Jo - `Well I a`int laughing ... but you`re gonna ... til you break!` With that Jo, went hell for leather, in an all out, expert attack on Rachel - there may have only been around eight minutes left, but Rachel was lost now, lost in desperation for the tickling to stop. Jo did everything perfectly. One hand would drag it`s nails delicately down from the elbow to the armpit - teasing the supple skin of Rachel`s upper arm. At the same time the other hand would be poking, probing and scraping the deep hollow of the other armpit. This unbalancing sensation was deadly in its effectiveness. It made Rachel twist violently - which only served to flatten out the hollow - which Jo would then dance her nails all over, producing yet another distinct senastion, forcing Rachel to once more pull hard on her bindings.

`Oh G-god .... P-Please ...`. Rachel didn`t really even know she had let the words slip amidst her now silent laughter, so deeply tormented was she ... Jo knew she was nearly there ...

`YES! - Go on bitch ... SAY IT!!! Say MERCY!!!`

`N-no, p-please, .... ah, d-don`t ...` Rachel`s words again trailed off - she could only half beg, half be defiant - all she wanted was for the torture to end.

Bzzzzzzzzz!

`O-Oh G-god!!!` screamed Rachel, as she realised through her tears of torment, what the loud intercom buzzer meant. Exhausted, and half delerious, she finally felt the kneading hands at her waist relent. Then the feathers, which had been sending shivers over her whole body from their application to her breasts, also fell away. She`d survived a whole hour of tickle torture - and she was mightily proud of it! But right now, all she could do was try to bring herself back from the brink of ticklish insanity. Yet she just couldn`t stop laughing ... and it took a few seconds for her to come round enough to realise why ...

`YOU CAN`T TAKE IT - ADMIT IT BITCH!!!!`

Jo was STILL tickling the tall woman`s armpits - with all the skill and verve she had been for the past twenty minutes.

`C`mon Jo - she made it fair and square` urged Sarah as the other women, through a sense of fair play prepared to leave the room - disappointed, but having enjoyed their hour of un.

`I GOT HER THOUGH ... SHE SAID IT - I`M SURE SHE DID ...`, Jo simply refused to give up and still tickled and tickled Rachel`s super sensitive underarms ...

`C-C`mon - S-Stop .. ah ha ha ...` begged Rachel as she suddenly feared that this girl was NEVER going to stop tickling her, and that nobody would stop her! ... her fears were quickly put to rest.

`Your time is up young lady!` Spoke Carol forcefully, as she re-entered the room. `Rachel here has done very well - as you know I`ve been watching it all on camera in order to adjudicate - and the time is most definitely up!` Carol walked over to where the dwarfish Jo stood - now finally ceasing her tickling of Rachel.

`Congratulations Rachel my dear` said Carol as she walked up to the gasping, sweat drenched contestant. Tara moved in to release Rachel`s arms from their restraints - `You`ve earnt your ten minute rest!`, Tara whispered warmly - still as pleasant as ever - even though she`d suffered a diabolical tickling at Rachel`s own hands a few hours earlier. Rachel managed a weary smile.

Tara led Rachel across to the large bed to let her lie down, collecting her blouse and bra for her on the way, all Rachel could do was lie there and try to recover as quickly as she could.

Oblivious to her surroundings, Rachel didn`t notice Elaine, Sarah and Mary leave the room with Tara, as Carol took Jo to one side ... `I was very impressed with your efforts Miss Sandler ... It seems as if you came up against a very strong willed ticklee in our young Rachel though`, said Carol somewhat conspiritorially

`I nearly had the bitch! ...` interrupted Jo, still disappointed at her failure, but quite flattered by Carol`s comments.

`If you will, I`d like you to come with me downstairs ... As I say, I`m most impressed with your tickling abilities and I`d like to make you an offer ...`

Jo was both pleased and shocked at this - but kept her cool, gum-chewing front all the same - not wanting to seem to eager.

`Well ... sure, I guess ... what`s it about ...?` replied Jo - feigning non-interest.

`Just follow me ...` gestured Carol. `I promise - you`ll love it!`

With that, the two left the room, leaving Rachel lying semi-naked, exhausted on the bed.
