Peggy was very excited about the coming of the new amusement
park. Ever since she was a little girl, she has always loved the amusement
park. All the games and rides. The fun house, and, especially, the house
of

horrors.

There was something about being frightened that Peggy enjoyed.
She wasn't quite sure what it was, but it was a feeling of helplessness. An
escape from the everyday, run-of-the-mill lifestyle. Perhaps it was because
she
could allow herself to become entranced by the ghosts, and goblins, knowing
that
no harm would come to her. Whatever the reason was, it was surely an
obsession
with Peggy. She had a macabre sense of adventure, and amusement. She was
always the first one to go to the latest horror films, no matter how
gruesome,
and she seemed unusually excited by tales of Medieval torture chambers, and
descriptions of unusual torments.

One of Peggy's favorite accounts, was that of Tickle torture.
She was very excited by the thought of this type of punishment. Of course,
being as ticklish as she was, Peggy could only imagine the madness it must
have
brought it's unfortunate victims, but it fascinated her just the same.

It was a comfortably warm Saturday evening, when Peggy went to
the debut of the new amusement park. The stars were shining brightly, and a
warm whisper of a breeze, whisked it's way through the crowded park.
Because

this was the debut weekend for the park, it would be open all night. The
weather couldn't be better, and the turnout was fantastic.

To Peggy's utter delight, she was to find out that the park
offered the largest horror house for 15 states! It was a feature attraction
that sported a special sideline attraction called "Dungeon Masters." The
theme
of this attraction was "Real Drama" as it would have happened in 15th and
16th
century Europe. Supposedly, there were to be recreations of actual
tortures,

performed on torture equipment, painstakingly detailed to that of the actual
instruments used in their time.

As it turned out, it seemed that the "Dungeon Masters"
attraction was the biggest success of the evening, handling lines some 500
people long. Outside the horror house, which looked more like a
Transylvanian
castle, there were robed figures, both male and female, with ghoulish masks
and
make-up, coaxing patrons to the line. From inside the castle, were heard
hideous screams, and ghoulish moans. Maniacal laughter permeated the soft
evening air. Excited and anticipatory guests waited patiently for their
turn
to
enter the evil dwelling.
After waiting on the long line for a while, it seemed obvious
that Peggy was not going to get into the attraction any time soon, but she
had
an idea! Being the spoiled daddy's girl that she was, and not wanting to
wait
for anything, she decided that there must be a better way to get into that
castle. Not only soon, but also, free! Looking at the tall 23 year old
brunette, one would never figure her to be the type so bold and spoiled, as
to
risk breaking a line that size just to get into a fun house. But that's
exactly
what this beauty intended to do.

She walked around to the back of the castle-like building, and
unsuspectingly, sneaked under the security fence. Everyone was so busy
having
fun, that they thought nothing of this. Peggy worked her way closer to the
building a little at a time, hiding behind bushes on her way.

There in the back, was a large, wooden door, bearing a large
sign that read: DO NOT ENTER! TRESPASSERS WILL BE SEVERELY DEALT WITH!
THIS
MEANS YOU! Peggy thought how easy it would be to say that she got lost.
What's
the worst they could do to her. She could charm her way out of anything.
Ignoring the sign, Peggy pressed the lever on the large door to find that,
to

her surprise, it was opened. Perhaps the owners thought no one would try to
get
in through there, being there was a sign and all.

Peggy opened the door slowly, peeking in both directions as she
entered. As she crept slowly inside, she could hear the ghastly sounds
clearer.


"Pre-recorded sound effects." She rationalized.

She came upon long corridors that were very dark, and the deeper she
dwelled,

the darker it got. After turning endless corners, and bumping into many
walls,
it occurred to her;

"I'm lost!" "For real!"

Peggy could hear the distant chatter and occasional excited
screams of the visitors, but each turn she made, seemed to lead her farther
away. Now she was really in trouble. She couldn't find the crowd, or the
exit!
In the realization of being in a purgatory between escape and discovery,
Peggy
could feel her heart beating faster, and harder. Suddenly, the desire to
gain
her objective seemed weaker. It wasn't quite so important as it was before.

She turned another corner. Something leapt out at her! It was only a
plastic
monster. As the sounds of the crowd seemed closer, Peggy figured she was
not

far from salvation.

"Just a little closer kid." You're almost there." She whispered to herself
in
an effort to console her anxiety.

As she groped the walls, she walked straight into someone! She
gasped in a startled fashion, and then sighed in relief.

"I'm sorry. Can you tell me which way the crowd is moving?"

There was no reply. In the darkness, Peggy could make out two robed and
hooded
figures. Suddenly, the figures grabbed her and began dragging her down the
dark
hallway! Peggy tried to fight the two of them off, screaming, and demanding
for
them to let her go, but they were too strong for her to escape their grasp.

They continued dragging her down the corridor, never speaking a
word. Peggy figured since she was obviously caught, she might as well
confess,
and get it done.

"Okay! You caught me." You can let me go now." I won't give you any more
trouble."

Again, no response. No indication at all that they even heard her!

One of the two robed figures swung open a door. The door marked
the entrance to a large room. Peggy asked in a concerned voice.

"Is this the exit? Where are we?"

The shadowy figures brought her to what felt like the middle of
the room. She could hardly see anything. Just outlines of what appeared to
be
a stone floor. The room was empty except a large, heavy looking piece of
furniture. Peggy could not quire make out what it was. She wasn't sure
what
is
was, but the figures were leading her there, leading her toward it.
Suddenly,
the two figures began grabbing at Peggy's clothes. Peggy fought like crazy
to
keep them away, but they grabbed her harder, and started stripping her of
her

shorts, and T-shirt!

"What the Hell is going on here? What are you doing to me?"

The silent captors finished their stripping job, and replaced
the garments with a burlap material, which fit like a short skirt set. Her
sneakers and socks were also removed, and replaced with leather slippers. A
rope was tied around the waist of the garment to serve as a belt, after
which

time, Peggy was forced to the floor.

Her back was pressed up against a thick wooden post, and her
wrists were bound behind her back, around it, with several loops of braided
rope. As one figure tied her hands, the other sat on her legs to keep them
from
kicking. Peggy was fighting as hard as she could, but to no avail. After
her
wrists were secured, each figure held a leg, and began removing the
corresponding slipper.

The struggling girl's ankles were firmly placed on what felt
like a padded ledge. It wasn't until she heard the "Bang" of wood on wood,
that
she realized she could not move her ankles. Whatever they had placed her
in,

was holding her fast, with no slack for mobility! After a few seconds, it
occurred to Peggy what she had been placed in.

"Stocks! Oh my God! This is impossible! What's going on? Someone talk to
me!
Please!"

She still got no response from her shadowy captors. Instead,
one of them walked over to her, and placed a pillow under her buttocks, and
behind her head. She could not figure out what the reason for this was, and
she
really did not care. All Peggy could think about was getting the Hell out
of

there.

Suddenly, and with no warning, a gag, with a long strap was
fitted into the terrified girl's mouth, and buckled tightly around the pole,
pinning her head to it. Her head was now completely immobile, and her eyes
were
wide with fear and anxiety as they scanned the room for some kind of clue
where
she was. The two captors exited the room, leaving poor Peggy bound
helplessly
and unable to speak!

After about 15 minutes, she could hear what sounded like pipe
organ music in the distance. The sound grew closer and closer, and Peggy
strained to scream for help. As the eerie music played on, a dim, red light
went on, slightly illuminating the room with an iridescent glow. What Peggy
saw
was shocking. She gasped at the sight. The room she was in, was decorated
exactly like a medieval dungeon, complete with manacles on the mortar, and
stone
walls. Her situation became even more desperate as she saw part of the wall
in
front of her slide open to reveal a giant, Plexi-Glass, viewing window!
Standing on the other side of it, wee all the people who paid for their
tickets
to see this!

Peggy became absolutely frantic at this point, trying to reach
someone out there with her pleading eyes. She struggled, but it was just no

use. Her bondage was genuine, and final. There was no room for movement.
The
only part of her body that could move effectively, were her bare feet and
toes.
Of course, the crowd figured she was wiggling to demonstrate her
helplessness.
Peggy screamed as best she could, but the sound was effectively muffled by
the
gag. Her eyes scanned the crowd, desperately, praying that someone would
figure
out her awful plight.

"Why are they all just standing there, watching me? Somebody do something!"


The helpless girl's mind raced furiously as she watched the
crowd's anticipation for what she did not know, was yet to come.

Just then, the two figures reentered the room. She can see them
now. They are two men, wearing hooded robes, with crosses embroidered on
the

front. One of them picked up a nearby microphone, and addressed the crowd:

"Ladies and gentlemen; Of all the things you have seen tonight, few can
compare
with what you are about to witness. During Medieval times, the dreaded
Inquisition imposed many types of tortures on their hopeless victims. The
effectiveness of this particular torture was so high, that it was
incorporated
as a regular practice, used frequently in many other dungeons all over the
world. We recommend anyone who is squeamish, to leave now."

As the speaker put the microphone down, the crowd huddled closer
to the window, gaping in excited, and curious anticipation. Peggy was still
squirming, even more so now that she had heard that little speech. Her
continuous struggling only proved repeatedly, the inescapability of her
bondage.
Peggy's two robed captors walked to a small table, situated directly behind
her. She could not turn her head to see what they were doing, which only
exaggerated her already frantic mental state. She could only hear movements
behind her, but the sudden facial expressions of the crowd in front of her,
made
her panic even more.

Suddenly, she could see them reentering her view. One was
holding a stiff Turkey feather, and the other was wielding a soft-bristled
brush. Peggy's stomach dropped hard as she realized what was about to
happen
to
her. Her greatest fascination, and, greatest fear, was about to come true
in

the most horrible way! Her incredibly desperate attempts to escape just
seemed
to rivet the crowd more intensely to her spectacle.

As the first man lowered the feather toward her helpless bare
right foot, Peggy squinted her eyes tightly in an attempt to block out the
feeling. The stiff feather was applied in long steady drags, from heel to
toe
tips, across the quivering wrinkled bare sole. Peggy wiggled her toes
quickly
in hopes of changing her mind's attention from the tickling to the physical
movement, but her tormentor was skilled, and persisted with the tickling
administrations in steady, unwavering motion.

Soon, the poor girl's senses could no longer hold out, and she
began to laugh. The torturer immediately withdrew, as if to taunt poor
Peggy

with the realization of her helplessness, and what was going to be done to
her.
It is now time for the second man to administer his torture too. On Peggy's
bound left foot, tickling, just under the toes, in short staccato strokes
with
his horse hair brush. The sensations of this tickling, sent Peggy crazy
from

the start. She began laughing very hard. The laughing quickly turned to
screams and pleading. After about 30 seconds, he too, withdrew. By now,
Peggy
was frantic. There was no way she wanted that done to her again. She knew
she
could not stand to be tickled. Tickling was one of her worst fears in life!

And to be tickled while bound helplessly, was just unthinkable. She would
do

anything to free herself.


The crowd peered in amazement as the tormentors renewed their
tickling attack on Peggy's bound, bare feet. Only this time, there would be
no
stopping. The feather was sliding around the spasmodically wiggling toes of
one
foot, while the brush was gently scrubbing the heel and instep of the other.

Peggy's laughter increased in volume and pitch as the tickling persisted.
She
was desperately trying to move her feet out of the way of the tickling,
screaming hysterical, laughing, crying and begging, all at the same time.
Her
mind was racing in furious panic as she prayed for the tickling of her feet
to
stop. She could not bear it. Tears were stroking her hysterical, red face,
and
her limbs were growing tired from the involuntary muscle spasms caused by
the

tickling torture! Despite Peggy's obvious Hellish agony, her tormentors
were

not letting up! Instead, they were expanding their torture of this poor
girl,
to her legs. They dropped their tickling tools, and began sliding their
fingers
up her bare, soft legs, making sure to tickle the backs of her calves and
thighs. As one tickled her legs, the other started tickling her helpless
knees,
kneading with abandon, just above the knee caps, which caused such violent
spasms of laughter, that Peggy figured someone would have to see that she
was

being tortured for real!

The pretend Inquisitors were making mental notes of poor Peggy's
most ticklish parts, returning to each, time after time after time. The
helpless creature was a pathetic sight of tortured female nerve endings.
The

persistent tickling was rapidly turning this beautiful young woman into a
mindless hysterical muscle spasm!

The crowd was silent, and completely glued to the activity.
They all seemed amazed at the acting ability of this woman. How could
anyone

stand that much tickling? Peggy's eyes seemed to scream out at the
audience.

"GOD NO! SOMEONE! ANYONE! PLEASE HELP ME! THIS IS REAL! I CAN'T TAKE
ANYMORE TICKLING! THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME IF THEY DON'T STOP!! CAN'T YOU
SEE
THAT?! OOOH OH OH NO NO NO NOOOO!!!! NOT AGAIN!!! NOT THE F-F-F-FEEET!!!
PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEEEAAAIIIIEEE HA HA HA HA HA HAAAIIIEE AHA HA
HA

HA!!!!!

Peggy's body and mind were on fire. Every nerve ending in her
5'8" frame had been lit on fire, like tiny fuses. Hundreds of thousands of
tiny
fuses, all burning at the same time, and her entire nervous system felt like
it
was going to explode! Never before had Peggy ever felt torment like this.
She
had been tickled in the past, but only briefly, and never with the animal
intent
that she was receiving now! Her sensitive ribs were next on the list.
Consistently prodded and poked by unseen fingers, Peggy's mid section and
abdomen spasmed uncontrollably. Her face was a mask of madness. The gag
refrained all attempts to release her pent up screams of laughter, pinning
her
head helplessly to the post, where she could only sit immobile, wiggling the
few
precious inches her bondage allowed.

Her red, tear blurred eyes blinked, and squinted rapidly under
her tormented duress. Her neck muscles peaked, and strained as her tender
throat unleashed burst, after burst of torture laughter. Her stomach
muscles

tightened harder with each unrelenting tickling attack on her incredibly
ticklish rib cage. As her sadistic tormentors spent minute, after eternal
minute, tickling her helpless upper thighs, and ribs, Peggy's toes wiggled
aimlessly at the gawking crowd. Her endless toe wiggling cased gentle
wrinkles
on her pretty pink soles.

The fire Peggy felt throughout her trapped body, had now spread
to her nipples and loins. As the tickling continued without stop, moving
back
down to behind her soft knees, she could feet her womanhood becoming swollen
and
hot with excitement. It was beginning to throb and pulsate like nothing she
had
ever felt before. It yearned to be touched, to be satisfied, but all she
would
get, would be more. . .More tickling. Her naked heels became the focal
point
of
both tormentors, using their nails to lightly scratch the delicate skin
there.
Her situation had become dire at this point, and she was sure she would be
tickled to death. The crowd was eagerly savoring every second of this
Hellish
torture. Her spectacle probed to be a fascinating, and entertaining sight
for
the visitors.

As the heel tickling progressed in intensity, Peggy's mind began
to go numb. Her eyes were ill focused, and her pussy was unbearably swollen
with excitement. If only one of these tormentors would just accidentally
touch
her there. She is sure she would come from just the slightest brush of his
hand. But. . .nothing. Nothing but tickling! The tormentors have returned
full strength to Peggy's bound bare feet, paying almost exclusive attention
to
her wriggling toes. Twenty fingers tickled the wildly spasming toes, as
Peggy
found the strength for a new onslaught of screaming laughter from the
unbearable
titillating tickling of her toes.

By this time, Peggy was just about ready to explode, whether she
was touched there, or not. Her body was operating at full overload
capacity.

Her brain was burning with sensory overload, and her limbs and diaphragm
ached
from excessive spasming. Her humiliation was peaking as her head was pinned
toward the peering crowd, and her bare, ticklish feet and toes were being
abused
by the endless manipulation of them by these sadist's skilled fingertips.

She could not stand another second. Her nipples were clearly
visible through her burlap garment. They felt like they are going to pop
from
the swelling, sexual tension. Peggy let out one final piercing scream that
was
laced with a torrential orgasm, the likes she has never experienced. Then,
she
passed out cold!

When she awoke, she was strapped to a rack, and could not move a
single muscle. Her arms were stretched high over her head, and her ankles
were
locked in another set of stocks at the foot of the rack, again, revealing
her

tender, bare feet for whatever abuse her tormentors might see fit. Her body
was
twitching from the torturous tickling ordeal, and her erogenous zones were
tingling with sexual sensitivity. The gag had been replaced with a
cylindrical
piece of cork, held in place with rope. From the corner of her eye, Peggy
could
see the viewing window, only this time, with a different crowd outside. The
robed man picked up the microphone, and began to speak:
Ladies and gentlemen; of all the things you have seen tonight, few can
compare
to what you are about to witness." Peggy's eyes sprang open with insane
fear!
Her mind could muster one
thought..........................."NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"!!!!!!
