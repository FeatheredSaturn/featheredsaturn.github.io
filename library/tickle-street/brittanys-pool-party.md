Stars of this story: Brittany, Candice, Melissa, and Meghan.

Meghan: Smallest girl on the block, everything is small about this cute strawberry blonde haired cutie. Her most ticklish spot is her tiny bellybutton, and she's quite a nut when she gets hyper.

Melissa: Quite shy and quiet, but when she comes out of her shell and gets comfortable, she's more laid back. Long brown hair with blonde streaks in it and pure hazel eyes, she's truly something to look at with a thin body. She's most ticklish under her very-sensitive knees, and loves acting.

Candice: Loves to be tickled and get in ticklish situations, but if the tickling goes too far, she's out of control. Dirty-blonde hair and crystal blue eyes, with a thin and nice body. She' most ticklish on her fit tummy.

Brittany: Ticklish, everywhere!!! Long black hair and exotic italian looks, but still with baby-cute cheeks. She's majorely ticklish everywhere and has a bit of a fear of being tickled!


Here's the story, ENJOY!!:\)


It was an unusually hot day for early September. It was Sunday, one more day until back to college for five straight days, the girls had to relish this. Brittany lagged around her house, completely bored, until she looked out her window...the pool!

Her family had a pool in their backyard, a ground-level one with nice white stone surrounding. It was a good size, and went from shallow to extremely deep. Brittany got an excited spark in her little mind, and began calling all the other girls on Tickle Street.

After half an hour, and calling all the other nine girls, only three others could come, Candice, Morgan, and Melissa.

All the others were apparently busy, and it seems that Sara and Morgan were still getting over some thing about ghosts or whatever. Nevermind them, she thought, four people was well enough for a good time beneath the sweltering sun.

Within twenty minutes, the three other girls arrived, all in t-shirts and shorts, with bathing suits beneath. Brittany greeted them all as they arrived with her irresistible cute Italian smile. They then all gathered in her fenced off backyard with the big pool and smooth patio. Brittany's family was pretty well off with her father starting a successful real estate company.

Brittany's mother and father were out for the day, so Brittany quickly fixed them all a big pitcher of lemonade, and left it on a table on the patio for when they got thirsty.

"Wow, what a great pool!" Meghan exclaimed, her eyes glaring at the untouched, smoooth, glassy-looking water.

"And it's a pefect day for a swim," Melissa added.

The girls couldn't wait any longer as the fierce eye of the sun beamed down on them, they HAD TO SWIM!

Meghan was the first to rip off her clothes, revealing a bright pink bikini, with lacey flower print. She dived into the pool, brought her wet face up to the surface and smiled widely.

Brittany was next, slipping off her tiny shorts and small tank top, revealing a dazzling black string-bikini, showing off huge amounts of tanned skin.

Next was Melissa, sliding smoothly out of her skirt and t-shirt, showing off her cute green bikini.

Candice was last, struggling with her clinging top, and finally removing it over her head, showing off her sexy tigher-design small bikini.

Now all four girls were in the cool water, splashing about and swimming merrily. Candice and Brittany were having a diving contest at the deep end, while Meghan and Melissa stroked in the shallower end.

"This feels so good!" Melissa said, laying back in the water and floating lazily.

"You said it," Candice quickly agreed, and then dived head-first into the water.

Candice emerged from the blue water, with a great idea.

"Let's play Marco Polo!"

They played rock paper scissors to see who would be "it" first, and it turned out Brittany lost at her own pool, and began counting.

When she reached twenty-five, she began wading through, her eyes shut, feeling ahead of her like an old blind man.

"Marco!" Brittany yelled out.

"Polo!" Melissa, Meghan, and Candice all yelled back in unison.

The voices all came from different directions, but still helped Brittany's ears a bit.

If your a Marco Polo veteran, you surely know of the cocky little trick, of sneaking behind "Marco," and lightly touching or tickling their foot under water. Only the quickest and most agile can perform this stunt, and Candice was gonna take a shot at it.

She slowly crept behind Brittany, and dove beneath the water without making a splash or a sound. Once she was under water, she opened her eyes, targeted on Brittany's wading left foot, and lightly tickled the sole.

"Heehee!" Brittany giggled, and immdediately shot her eyes open, only to find Candice smiling widely behind her.

"Hey, no opening your eyes!" Candice protested.

"No tickling!" Brittany shot back, but had a better idea, and tackled Candice in the water. When she had a firm grasp on the unsuspecting blonde, she began to quickly wiggle her fingers into her unprotected sides. Candice exploded with high-pitched giggles, and thrashed about in the pool, causing water to fly everywhere.

"hey, that's not fair!" Melissa said, standing up for Candice, as she sneaked behind Brittany, and began to rub up and down her bare sides.

"Hahahaha!!!" Brittany squirmed away, and climbed out of the pool just in time, as Meghan dived for her ticklish foot. Meghan missed, and got a face full of water in return.

Brittany then made for the sliding door that led into her house, but as she tugged the handle, she remembered she had locked it, from the inside!

She turned around, to see all three girls surrounding her against the door.

"No girls, don't you dare tickle me!" Britney screamed, but it fell upon deaf ears, as they continued slowly moving in on their ticklish italian prey.

Brittany then made a run for it, trying to break past Meghan's side of the quickly closing in semi-circle.

But it didn't work, Meghan wrapped her small arms around Brittany's small waist, and dragged her to the side of the pool. That was where they began. Meghan held her arms above her head, while Melissa sat on her calfs, and Candice straddled her thin waist.

"Ready for the tickle monster Brittany?" Candice teased, forming a claw with her left hand.

"Nooooo!!!!" Brittany screamed out, but Meghan and Melissa had to much weight on her limbs for her to get away. Candice lowered the tickle claw on Brittany's silky smooth side, and began noisely "eating" her side.

"Hahahahaahhaahahhehehahahhehaaaaaaahahahaahaaaa!!! !!!!!!" Brittany laughed like a mad woman, tugging madly, trying to get inevitably free.

"Oh look! The tickle claw has a friend!" Candice exclaimed, still in her playing, as her other hand formed a similiar claw, and mercilessly dug into her other side. By now, Brittany was laughing intensely at the top of her lungs. Candice was about to drop a finger into Brittany's adorable oval shaped bellbutton, when Melissa jumped her from behind, raking her nails up and down Candice's extremely ticklish, flat tummy.

Candice went nuts with sweet never-ending giggles, as she tryed to curl into a ball to the side of Brittany, but it didn't work. Her blonde hair swayed and her limbs went kicking and thrashing as her super-sensitive tummy was cruely tickled by Melissa's long, well pedicured nails.

Candice was going insane with laughter, curling to her left, only to expose one side of her tummy, which when she rolled to that side, only exposed the other side of her tummy. It was a lose-lose situation.

Meghan couldn't just watch all this exciting tickling going on without her, and just as Brittany got her breathe back, Meghan lightly stroked her vulnerable armpit. Brittany looked at her and giggled, but all of a sudden flipped around, grabbing Meghan's left sole in a football lock with one arm, and scratching slowly her soft sole.

"Hheeheheheheheheeheeheeee!!" Meghan was a huge giggler, and her cute giggles streamed out like crazy.

Brittany liked being on the other end of this cruel tickling, as a gleam of light shown in her eyes. She lightly danced her gentle fingers from heel to arch, and back and down again. Brittany smiled a mile wide, and then lowered her head with an evil thought, and quickly licked one of her toes.

"Heeee!!!!!" Meghan squealed out, and Brittany loved it, and slowly licked each toe, with Meghan shrieking each time.

Candice had eventually gotten out of Melissa's ticklish clutches, and turned the tickling around. By a twist of lucky fate, Candice had found her most ticklish spot, and squeezed Melissa's knees mercilessly.

"Haaaahahahaahahhheehaaaaa!!!!!!!" Melissa screamed loudly, rattling her whole body.

Her soft hair flew about like crazy as her laughter caused her whole thin body to vibrate. Candice then with one hand, traveled up her thigh, stroking it slowly, another sensitive spot on Melissa's body.

Meghan fought back with a burst of power, and regained her position on her feet. Brittany stood up, and they dug into each other's ribs, mercilessly tickling as they both swayed back and forth, struggling to stay standing.

They swayed to and fro, coming to the edge of the pool. Candice quickly looed up, abandoned ticklish Meliss,a and ran to push the two girls into the pool.

They landed with a loud splash as water flew everywhere. They both looked up as they emerged, scowling at Candice, who suddenly flew in with them, as melissa snuck up behind her and pushed her in.

Melissa stood up triumphantly, with all the other girls in the pool below her.

"I win!" Melissa exclaimed.

"I don't think so!" Then Brittany pulled her by the foot, as she crashed into the cool water.

The four girls spent the rest of the day swimming and having fun, but when they played Marco Polo again, they couldn't wait to try the trick!
