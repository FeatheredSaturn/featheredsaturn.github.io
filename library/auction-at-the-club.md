“I blame you for this and everything that's about to happen.”

Peering out the corner of his eye, Sam couldn't help but smirk at Lucy's words. Granted, she was partly right. It had been him who had discovered this club and found the job advert. Their marriage was coming up and the venue they had their heart set on was rather pricey. The job for two 'models' at a local fetish club promised to give them the boost they needed to meet their target. But, contrary to Lucy's words, she had been the one most eager for it, not for the money exclusively, but she was always open to 'experimentation'.

Looking at Lucy, Sam smiled as he kept that in mind. His fiancée was quite unconventional in a lot of ways, sporting a punk look about her, hair dyed dark with a side shave, one cut almost to the skin and the long style fell down to her shoulders, dark with purple tips. Her skin was pale, decorated by dark tattoos with a spider theme that ran along her arms and legs. Her eyes were a pale blue that shone whenever she smiled, which was a lot. Whenever she got an impish look on her face, Sam knew he was in for a fun time.

Sam himself was a direct contrast to Lucy. Whereas she was short, curvy and pale, he was tall, chiselled and had mahogany toned skin. His hair was cut neatly and straight, topping a straight face with handsome features and dark eyes. He didn't smile quite as often as Lucy, but when he did, she always insisted that it made her feel 'gooey'. With his height, he enjoyed pulling Lucy up into a hug with her legs dangling over the ground, the two of them quite affectionate.

Being quite attractive, both of them had managed to get the job quite easily. After two interviews and clearing any matters, they had agreed to take part in the current event, an auction. They, along with six other people, were on display in the club, bound in various positions. Sam was set on a vertical table, arms and legs spread out in an 'X' shape. Lucy was on a table as well, but in a different position, kneeling while her ankles were set into stocks and her upper body was placed against a padded board, arms stretched out from side to side. In front of them was a table holding a box and a sheet of papers people would write their names and their bids on before putting them into the box's slot.

Both were completely naked.

Thankfully, the club was pretty warm. They were currently in a large room, both of them, and the others that were part of the auction, on display around the room, next to the walls. The centre was taken up by a selection of tables and there was a bar on the far end to help with mingling. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. Far beyond what Sam had expected when he and Lucy had first arrived for their interviews.

Thinking about what Lucy had said, Sam shrugged as best he could considering how he was bound. Thankfully, everything was padded, so comfort wasn't an issue “Just remember who it was who first said that they could handle a little tickling and how much fun it would be.”

During the interviews, both Sam and Lucy were tested in their sensitivity. While a part of him had enjoyed it (Especially when it was Lucy's turn), Sam now knew why it was called 'tickle torture'. Tonight promised to be incredibly intense and sexually charged. The thought of it made Sam's cock start to grow, much to Lucy's delight as she noticed it.

“Oh yeah, one of us thinks it's going to be fun alright.” She taunted him, moving as much as she could in her bonds so her ample chest would jiggle, something that always made Sam hot under the collar “I bet you'll just love one of the women in here to tease us both with a feather duster all night long...”

Sam didn't deny it, the fact his erection was rapidly growing at the thought proved it. When they had been told that the theme of the night was tickling and bondage, it was a surprise. While certainly not vanilla, the couple hadn't really considered tickling as a kink until answering the advert. Now, the two were making some very special plans for their honeymoon.

“Mm, you two are giving me ideas!” A friendly voice called out as Crystal approached. Crystal was big. Not just physically, with the term 'BBW' seemingly having been created to describe her, but in personality as well. She was friendly and warm, but certainly didn't suffer nonsense from others. She was a businesswoman after all and made sure to take care of herself. To Sam and Lucy, while finding her a tough negotiator when it came to their contract for the auction, she was something of a big teddy bear outside of it. She was taller than Lucy and much more curvy as well. She was currently wearing a red dress that contrasted well with her dark skin. Her hair feel down her shoulders in curls and her eyes had a mischievous spark in them as she looked at the trapped couple, a smile showing widely on her face.

“Well, you have to pay to act them out!” Lucy countered, earning herself a few tickles as Crystal reached out and danced her fingers up and down the goth woman's bare sides.

“Honey, I am the manager. I do whatever I want!” Crystal retorted as Lucy squeaked with laughter and squirmed from the light tickling before it stopped after a few seconds “Oh, you two are going to be a hit tonight!”

Sam didn't respond at first, having been taken in by the sight of Crystal teasing his fiancée. He was fully erect now, feeling a little embarrassed, but also idly wondering what this meant for their chances of getting higher bids. He tried to focus as Crystal went on.

“We're just about to open the doors. Now remember, if anyone's going too far, the safeword is 'red', alright? And if they're causing you any trouble or problems, call out 'blue'. Got it?” Both Sam and Lucy nodded at that. They'd been told the safety procedures and had met the bouncers for the club who certainly looked as if they could handle any trouble. Seeing they were up to speed, Crystal smiled “OK, now the girls and guys will be coming around with water throughout the evening. Speak to them if you've got any problems. They'll also be giving out the tools to the guests, so remember to be really polite to them.”

Chuckling nervously at the joke, Sam and Lucy's attention was instantly drawn to the double doors at the end of the room as they opened, letting in the crowd. Crystal gave the two a comforting wink “Show time. Good luck.” She said, before moving to meet the auctioneers.

With only moments to go before they were going to be checked out by the people entering the room, Sam and Lucy shared a glance. After the auction, whoever won them got them for a night later in the week. Plenty of time to recover, but only made the tension that much more intense and unbearable.

“Ready for this?” Sam asked, unable to keep a faint shake from out of his voice.

Looking down at the approaching crowd, Lucy grinned “Not as if we've got a choice.” She pointed out as a couple approached them. A man and a woman, both approaching middle age with some grace as they were tall and fit looking, the man with a silver streak in his hair and the woman showing a natural beauty about her as she looked at the trapped couple with a pleased expression on her face. Both wielded stiff feathers, gained from those carrying the trays around and didn't look afraid to use them either.

“Oh, you two look perfectly adorable!” The woman gushed, her hands wandering up Sam's sides, making him giggle and flinch “And so sensitive as well!”

“Now, now, we've not even tried them out yet.” The man said as he laid his hands on Lucy's sides and began to squeeze them with light pinches. She instantly burst into a flurry of giggles that complimented Sam's own. The couple proved to be very adept at tickling as they kept up the light pressure on Sam and Lucy, fingers exploring their bodies to find the spots that made them laugh the most.

Like this, the tickling was almost playful, even fun. The fingers probed their trapped bodies, exploring their naked forms gleefully. The woman found that her finger probing into Sam's navel caused his laughter to shoot out louder than before. Lucy herself was quickly discovering that a pair of skilled hands teased the sides and undersides of her breasts was enough to make her howl.

The couple were expert ticklers, no doubt. They were able to use their fingers to find the most efficient ways possible to make Lucy and Sam really laugh. Both of them were soon wriggling as much as they could in their bondage, the tickling becoming more intense with each passing moment, the navel teasing on Sam making his midriff twitch and clench as he tried to pull away, to to no effect. The fingers gliding along the soft skin of Lucy's breasts not only made her laugh, but touched in just the right ways to start and make her moan as well as her nipples began to harden.

All too soon though, it came to an end as the man and woman withdrew their fingers, leaving Lucy and Sam panting, but not exhausted and willing to continue. The man and the woman spoke to each other briefly before writing down a bid and placing it in the box “You two certainly are a lot of fun.” The woman said earnestly “I do so hope we get to see you later on.”

“I wouldn't say no.” Lucy said in a flirty tone, causing the couple to smile brightly before leaving.

As no one was around them at that time, Sam breathed out “OK, that was... not as intense as I expected.”

“They were just playing. I think because we're new to this, they wanted to be nice.”

“Well, here's hoping these two feel the same.” Sam mused as he saw two women approach, a tingle of fear going through him as he saw that they were each carrying a bottle of baby oil and a hair brush. Neither he nor Lucy had experienced being tickled like that before and the thought of it happening made both clench their toes automatically.

The women were both around their thirties, wearing figure-hugging cocktail dresses and all smiles as they checked out Sam and Lucy. After the courtesies were done, they were all business however and went over to their feet. They showed their expertise as they rubbed the baby oil into the feet before them, their fingers doing a great job as they kneaded the skin in an very pleasurable way.

“Mmm...” Lucy murmured as the fingers made her feel wonderful “If this is what you're planning, I'm hoping you guys win.”

This got a laugh from the women as they massaged the feet “Honey, with the feet you two have, we're willing to put in a very large bid indeed.” One said as she rubbed the oil into Lucy's soles.

Both Lucy and Sam indeed had nice feet, matching the rest of their bodies. Lucy's were relatively small and chubby, her toenails painted a shade of black and the subject of frequent pedicures. Sam's feet were well cared for as well, the long soles having deep arches and were topped by slender toes that were proving to be quite a hot spot for a massage. Even more than Lucy, Sam was getting lost in the pleasure of the fingers rubbing the oil into his skin. When it ended, he let out a slight sigh of disappointment.

“Now, let the real fun begin.” The woman at Sam's feet said as she suddenly raked his fingers down his left foot. Sam's entire body spasmed and he barked with laughter, the ticklish sensations on his foot catching him completely off guard. His feet had been sensitive before, but now? He looked at Lucy, the realisation hitting both of them before the tickling began properly, their now hyper-sensitised feet.

The two women had obviously prepared well for this, their long nails proving to be highly effective in making Lucy and Sam scream the instant that they contacted the skin. The oil had soaked in and was proving to be incredibly effective in making the ticklish sensations even worse than before. The nails scratching away at their soles were tickling far worse than they would have done normally, the sensations coursing through them greatly amplified by the oil.

Sam's laughter grew louder as both his feet were soon under attack from the woman's nails. He couldn't believe how ticklish he was now as the light scratching on his feet grew in speed and pressure. Everything from his heels to his toes were soon being assaulted by the tickle attack, causing him to pull against his bondage all the harder. The time for teasing was over as she was seemingly focused on outright tickle torture of Sam's feet.

Lucy was in just as bad a position, her body jiggling with each and every touch those fingers visited upon her naked feet. Curling her toes did little good as her attacker merely pulled them back, exposing the length of her digits to those same nails, tickling the soft skin along the toes and even wriggling into the spaces between them. Sam received a similar treatment, the attempt to stop the tickling on his toes ending once they were pulled back and a nail began to flick across the tips of them, sending ticklish tremors up his spine. Both he and Lucy shook with laughter, earning some rather admiring glances from the people in the room at the spectacle.

Even with the nails having tickled them close to tears, neither Lucy nor Sam were prepared for what was to come. When the tickling suddenly stopped, both took in lungfuls of air gratefully, glad of the break and wondering if this would get them a bid from the women. They had completely forgotten about the brushes right up until they first felt the bristles suddenly rub against their soles.

The effects were instantaneous as the couple screamed as loud as they could, the tickling overwhelming them the moment they felt it. The stiff bristles on the brushes rubbed over their soles, the free hands of the women keeping their feet in place as they tortured them. Sam lost it completely when he felt the ticklish-scratching sensation go over his heels, his skin crawling from the tickle torture.

Had he been of the mind to look over to Lucy, he would have seen her in dire straits as well. She seemed to be trying to lunge forward, out of her bondage as the brush attacked her arches, moving from one to the other as they stroked the sensitive skin. Within moment, Lucy was blubbering and yelling, unable think straight.

Unable to take it for too long, Sam broke first, crying out “RREHEHHHEEEEDD!!!” With Lucy doing the same seconds afterwards. The two women kept to the rules and stopped instantly, leaving the couple hanging in the bonds, shaking and gasping as the phantom tickles continued to rub haunt their skin.

“Mm, you two are a lot of fun.” One of the women said as the other wrote down a bid and placed it into the box “If we win this, you better expect a lot more action with these.” She went on, waving the brush under Sam's nose before she and her friend left, looking back over their shoulders as they grinned in a predatory way.

“H-Hopefully not that m-much more.” Lucy gasped out, Sam nodding along with her as he curled his toes, flexing them repeatedly to help banish the ticklish sensations crawling over his soles.

At least the display had encouraged others to make their bids, several people and groups came forward to slip their papers into the boxes and give a few quick tickles as well, although nowhere as near as intense as it had been with the brushes. After a while, both Sam and Lucy were both giggly and flushed, starting to enjoy it once more when a man approached them.

He was young looking, only in his early twenties from the looks of things. He was slender person, dark hair and wearing a loose fitting shirt and jeans. His dark eyes showed a good deal of humour and there was, of all things, a make up brush in his hands. He had a bright smile as he approached Sam and Lucy, looking friendly enough “Well, looks as if you two have been having some fun already.”

“In a manner of speaking.” Lucy replied, still rather giggly from a series of raspberries her belly had been given by a passer by.

“And how about you?” The man asked Sam, looking him up and down with a keen eye before focusing on his erection “Seems like you've enjoyed yourself.”

Same felt his cheeks heat up at the teasing words, having almost forgotten about his arousal until now. He was flustered enough to be unable to think of a decent response before the make up brush suddenly shot out, flicking over the tip of his penis. Sam let out a gasp and then burst into giggles that were heavily interspersed with moans. It didn't tickle anywhere near as bad as other things had done, but having the soft bristles swirl around the head of his cock was almost as intense as the hairbrush on his feet had been, just in a different way.

Sam twisted about in his bonds, unable to escape from the deathly soft touch of the make up brush as his arousal climbed higher and higher. Any attempt to beg for it to stop was just cut off by him giggling, or, if the soft bristles flicked over his slit, an intense moan that made his body shake. A part of him wondered if he was starting to enjoy this much more than anything else so far as he got hornier with each passing second.

The young man locked eyes with Sam, his face a wolfish expression as he purred, "Only another man truly knows how to tickle and tease a cock. And yours is so easy to enjoy..."

The words made Same gasp as the young man proved how true they were, the make up brush swirling over the head and even the man's fingers softly teasing along the underside of his shaft. The expert touch was torturous and exhilarating at once. Looking at the young man, Sam could feel a yearning to be touched like that more from him, even as it proved to be the most overwhelming and delicious torment he'd ever experienced.

Soon, Sam felt as if he was on the verge of an orgasm, his hips shifting forward as he wanted to be teased and tickled more, just to be pushed over the edge. Then, with one final flick of the brush over Sam's helmet, the young man stopped, pulling the brush away with a grin “Ah-ah-ah, not yet.” He taunted, discarding the make up brush and pulling another from his pocket.

If Sam had been in a right state of mind, he would have likely sworn up a storm at the sudden overwhelming sensation of frustration that hit him at being unable to cum. The teasing tickles with the brush had made him get so close and then to suddenly stop was a special kind of torture. At it was, he merely moaned and gasped, trying to settle his addled mind as a strong of pre-cum dangled from his cock.

“Well, now the guy has had his fun, time for the...” The young man went on, only to pause as he looked at Lucy whose face was quite red, her eyes open wide and she was breathing heavily.

“R-Really?” Sam asked, half-annoyed, half-amused “You got off on seeing that?”

“Really? Kink shaming me here and now?” Lucy retorted, sticking her tongue out at Sam before letting out a squeak as the young man flicked the make up brush over her nipple. Like Sam, she was already somewhat aroused and this man knew exactly how to use it.

“Now, now. No shame, only giggles and moans.” The young man said as he leaned down and flicked the brush over Lucy's pussy. She jumped in her bonds with a yelp and blushed even deeper than before. She had always been quite sensitive down there, not really helped as she shaved it and she was now coming to see how bad it might be for her.

The brush flicked over her lower lips, instantly causing Lucy to burst into a series of high pitched giggles from the ticklish sensations running through her most sensitive region. There was a difference between her and Sam though, as it was apparent that her pussy was a good deal more ticklish than Sam's cock was, making this more work for the young man, if you could call it that.

“OhoohOOHoohohstothhoooppp!!!” Lucy squealed as she tried pulling herself away from the brush, raising her body as much as she could tied as she was. She barely managed a few centimetres before reaching her limit however and fell back down, the bristles of the brush rubbing against her womanhood as the young man smirked with glee.

Sam could see why Lucy had gotten so hot under the collar. Seeing her like this was taking up all his attention as he watched his fiancée gasp, giggle and plead for the tickling to stop. The way her body jiggled and moved as she tried to escape from the light, but incessant ticklish feelings on her pussy kept his arousal high and he wished more than ever that the man had finished him off.

He watched as the young man slowed down the brush, stroking Lucy's damp pussy as the brush moved back and forth, taking great care to stroke every inch of bare skin. It wasn't too long before the giggling was joined with moans although they were softer than Sam's had been, the tickling overriding the sense of arousal she was feeling.

With one final long, slow drag of the brush that caused Lucy to jerk in her bondage, the young man finally pulled away, smiling broadly as he walked over to the bidding box “Oh, I'm really hoping I get the right bid on you guys.”

“... Please tell me you intend on letting us cum if you actually win.” Sam said, his eyes on the make up brush.

The young man playfully adopted an expression as if he was in deep thought and then smiled brightly “Nope!” He exclaimed before walking off.

Sam's cock twitched at the thought of being on edge like this, tickled by someone who knew exactly to take them to the brink without pushing them over it. It would be a draining ordeal alright. Looking over to Lucy, the two looked each other in the eyes, sharing an equal amount of excitement and dread over the prospect.

“I am so damn horny right now...” Lucy gasped, leaning her head backwards “I don't care how tired we are after this, we need to have five minutes together before I can sleep.”

“Five minutes, huh? Glad to see you've got that much faith in my abilities.” Sam said, earning a giggle from Lucy. Even in their current situation, the two enjoyed a bit of verbal back and forth.

Lucy snorted at the comment, losing her composure as another figure stepped towards them. This one was a tall woman, wearing a figure-hugging cocktail dress. She looked to be in her middle ages, but had aged well with her hair styled in a perm. As Sam went to speak to her, she cut him off instantly with a tickle attack right to his sides and ribs. Sam let out a bark of laughter as her long fingers squeezed right into his sides, finding the spot just under the ribcage to be a sensitive spot.

Sam threw his head back and laughed long and hard at the fingers digging into his skin. He wiggled weakly in his bonds, his energy largely having faded at this point as the tickling had drained him. The woman showed herself to be a ruthless tickler, exploiting every weak spot she found as her fingers travelled over Sam's torso. The only time she seemed to smile was when she plunged a finger into Sam's navel and wiggled it about almost violently, causing him to howl in ticklish anguish.

The tickling seemed to come to an end when the woman's hand gripped Sam's cock and began to stroke and jerk it. Like her tickling, the touch was efficient and intense, making Sam splutter and moan as he moved his hips in time with her strokes, her hand speeding up until he was tantalisingly close to an orgasm. Just when he got close, the stroking instantly stopped and Sam let out a strangled moan at being denied once again. His cock bobbed as the pre-cum dribbled onto the floor, the frustration he was feeling now almost maddening with its intensity.

Leaving Sam hanging as she did, the woman quickly marched over to Lucy's feet, starting a ticklish assault there as she scratched at the arches, her fingers expertly tickling the sensitive flesh. Lucy screamed as her oiled up feet retained their sensitivity from earlier, proving to still be insanely ticklish to any kind of touch. The woman was as merciless with her as she was with Sam, zeroing in on the toes as she wriggled her fingers right into the spaces between the digits in a way that actually made Lucy start to cry with laughter.

Before the goth woman would scream out the safeword though, the tickling stopped as the woman started to play with Lucy's slit. Her fingers rubbed over the area, sliding back and forth when she walked around to face her front. Her mind still frazzled by the foot tickling, Lucy mewed and gasped as she felt herself grow hornier by the second. Babbling softly, Sam couldn't make out if she was trying to beg for it to stop or was just lost in a haze of torment from the intense sensations.

Suddenly, the fingers massaging Lucy's slit puled away, Sam noticing them glistening as the woman walked over to the box and placed in a bid. She looked at them and said “Satisfactory.” Before turning away.

Both Sam and Lucy were a bit taken aback by this, breathing heavily as they recovered and their loins still aching for release “I-I kinda want the make up brush guy to come back.” Lucy said with a groan, Sam nodding in agreement.

Thankfully for their nerves, the bell rang signifying the end of the auction barely a few minutes later. The guests paused in their actions as Crystal held up her hands to get everyone's attention “Ladies and gentlemen! The time for bidding is over!” She called out “Now we find out who the winners are!”

Leading the crowd towards Sam and Lucy, Crystal unlocked the box and started to pull out the bids, looking through them one by one before smiling “I see you two were very popular.” She said, earning a laugh from the crowd “The winning bid, at $3700, goes to Marcie Lace!”

The crowd gave polite applause as the tall woman with the cocktail dress stepped forward. She smirked as she saw the expressions on Sam and Lucy's faces as she broke from the group while they went to look at the other bids.

“Ready for an evening with me and Crystal?” Marcie asked, catching the couple off guard.

“W-Wait, what do you mean?” Sam asked, caught off guard by that.

“Oh, you think Crystal only takes the money? No, she also has her fun with you once the auction's done. She does so like to mix business with pleasure.”

Sam looked over to the crowd where Crystal was and their eyes met. Just from that single look on her face when she saw Sam looking at her, he knew there and then that he could not expect mercy from her. He and Lucy would spend an entire night as her and Marcie's tickle toys. He felt a shiver of fear and excitement run down his spine at the thought of this.

“... I still want my five minutes.” Lucy announced, making Sam realise that so did he. Maybe they could always come back for another auction in the future...
