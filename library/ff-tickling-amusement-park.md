"Heyyyy!" Both women said as they hugged. Kris and Selina were at the entrance to Playland amusement park. They had met a few weeks back at a book club and immediately hit it off. This was their first date, and Selina had been immediately taken by Kris' sweet demeanor and her attractiveness, with her short, wavy brown hair and kind brown eyes.

They chatted some at the park entrance and Selina took in Kris' outfit, jeans that hugged her long legs and and a knotted shirt which emphasized her breasts and had a small strip of belly showing beneath the hem. This delighted Selina who had wished to get a look at Kris's belly, more and more finding herself daydreaming about rubbing it and wondering what sort of belly button Kris had. This might be my best chance to do that, Selina thought to herself.

They spent some time wandering around the park, taking in the sights and riding a couple rides. Selina won a stuffed animal at ring toss, Kris didn't win anything at the basketball throw but Selina did get to see Kris' shirt ride up a bit more exposing more belly for a few seconds. Eventually they had made it over to the test-your-strength game.

"I bet I'm stronger than you are." Selina said with a wink. She got a respectable score then it was Kris' turn, all of Selina's focus was on the belly of Kris. Kris reared back with the mallet to strike the lever, raising her arms as she did and having her shirt rise up.
"Awww it's so cute." Selina said out loud. Kris had a pale, slightly pudgy belly, with a small circular belly button that was pretty deep.

"What's cute? You know I beat your score right?" Kris said going back to Selina.

"Uhh your butto.. butt." Selina awkwardly stammered out. Kris giggled but didn't press the matter.

I have got to find more ways to see her belly button, Selina thought to herself, in case things didn't work out. After riding the merry-go-round Selina had a idea.

They got on the ferris wheel and as they approached the top Selina tried her plan. "Hey Kris, when we get to the top let's pretend we're Jack and Rose from Titanic when Rose is standing at the edge of the ship with her arms out."

Kris got up and spread out her arms, Selina behind her, and put her hands on the sides of Kris and felt her exposed belly. I'm going to risk it, Selina thought, moving her hands toward the middle of Kris's belly and hugging her from behind, the palm of one hand over Kris' navel. When the ride ended and Selina pulled back from the hug she dipped her finger slightly into Kris' innie as she pulled her hands away from her belly. Selina heard stifled laughter and saw Kris trying not to smile.

"I want to ride it again and switch roles." Kris said.
Selina agreed and as the ferris wheel approached the top once again she assumed the role of Rose with her arms spread out. Kris placed her hands on Selina's slim sides and said, "I want you to close your eyes for me okay?"

Selina thought it was weird but did so. She started to daydream about Kris's belly and navel some more when... "Hahahehahhehehahahahhahahah!" Selina erupted with laughter, Kris tickling the tan, flat belly on Selina along with fingering her inbetweenie belly button.
"I've wanted to do that for so long." Kris said with a blush. "And it looks like I'm lucky because you're a lot more ticklish then me."

"I haven't even really tried to tickle you yet." Selina said after she caught her breath.
Kris raised her eyebrow. "Is that so?" She said, fluttering her eyelashes and smiling at Selina. "Well maybe you'll get another opportunity."

Once the ferris wheel approached the ground the women climbed off. Selina took Kris' hand in hers and was rewarded by a shy smile from Kris. Hand-in-hand they walked through the amusement park until they reached the roller coaster. The cart was full when they climbed on, sitting side-by-side in one of the middle rows.

As the cart began to move up along the track Selina reached over and began wiggling her fingers over Kris' soft belly. She could see Kris biting her lip and trying not to laugh. When the cart tipped over the top of the track and began speeding along, Selina moved her fingers even faster across Kris' belly. Unnoticed by the other riders due to their delighted screaming, Kris began laughing.

Selina chanced slipping her finger inside Kris' innie, unable to resist any longer. Finally she slid her finger down to the bottom of Kris' belly button where she could feel her small round navel knot at the bottom. "Ahahahaha thahahat tihihihickles!" Kris giggled cutely while Selina swirled her finger around inside her navel.

As the cart began to slow on the roller coaster track Selina reluctantly pulled her fingers away. The two women climbed out of the cart. "That was fun!" Kris said enthusiastically.
She must enjoy being tickled, Selina though to herself while grinning. Wanting to find more opportunities to tickle Kris during their date, Selina looked around the amusement park as they walked through it. Her eyes skipped over the ferris wheel and merry-go-round which they'd already been on, and landed on the funhouse.

Kris must've had the same idea because she pointed at the large, colorful funhouse and said, "Let's go there next."

They walked into the funhouse and entered a long, dark hallway. At first Selina was disappointed since she'd expected the funhouse to be a bit more exciting, and she was still trying to find more ways to see or touch Kris' belly. "Aah!" Selina yelped with surprise as a sudden blast of air shot up from the floor, blowing up the hem of Selina's shirt to expose her flat, tan belly.
Kris shrieked as the same thing happened to her, a jet of compressed air blowing up her knotted shirt to reveal the entirety of her soft, pale belly. Selina watched with amusement as Kris pulled down her shirt, only for another sudden blast of air to cause it to ride up again. "Maybe this is a sign." Selina said with a smile. She reached over and began to tickle Kris' exposed belly and belly button.

"Ahahaha sign tohoho tihihickle mehehe?" Kris asked through her soft giggles. She squirmed slightly underneath Selina's dancing fingers but Selina noticed that the other woman wasn't making much of an effort to get away. However while Selina was tickling her, Kris reached over and poked Selina's belly button which was exposed by the gusts of air coming from the floor.

"Hahahehehehahahaha!" Selina exclaimed, bursting into laughter while Kris fingered her inbetweenie. "Truhuhuce!"

Giggling, both women stopped tickling each other and finished walking down the airy hallway. When they turned the corner they were met with the sight of a large ball pit that they needed to wade through in order to continue on through the funhouse. Kris and Selina both jumped into the pit and Selina was surprised to realize that the pit was deep enough that she sunk in to her breasts.
She slowly began making her way through the balls as Kris followed behind her. She could feel the fist-size balls pressing against her body as she pushed through them, but she was taken aback by a new sensation brushing along her slim sides. "Ahahahahehehehe!"

From behind Kris had reached through the balls and was scribbling her fingers over Selina's sides and flat belly. "I don't know, I think you're definitely more ticklish than me!" Kris said.
Selina tried to keep walking through the ball pit but she was slowed down even more by trying to walk while enduring tickling sensations. "Hahahahahaha nohohoho!" She squeaked when Kris started rubbing her inbetweenie belly button. "Nohohot my behehelly buttohohon!"

Kris continued poking Selina's navel for another moment before pulling away and allowing them both to exit the ball pit. They climbed out and walked down the hallway and up a long flight of stairs. When they got to the top there was another hallway filled with mirrors.

"Look!" Kris exclaimed, pointing at their reflections which the mirrors were distorting to look ridiculously short or absurdly fat. Kris stopped in front of one mirror that elongated her reflection, making her look much taller and thinner than she really was. "I could be a supermodel."
"Aww who needs to be a supermodel? You're cute enough already." Selina said, wiggling her fingers playfully over Kris' side. She just couldn't seem to stop tickling her date but since Kris wasn't complaining, Selina wasn't planning on stopping.

Kris blushed and smiled at her. "You know you're pretty cute yourself."

At the end of the hall of mirrors was a long slide which led to the exit of the funhouse. Selina went first and slid down - the slide was steeper than it looked at the top and she flew down it, landing against a padded wall at the bottom. Kris came down right after her and landed on top of Selina. "Oof!" They both grunted, giggling from the impact.

Instead of moving away Kris stayed on top of Selina, pinning her down with Kris' body. Selina felt her heart beating faster as Kris smiled down at her, before suddenly beginning to tickle her belly. "Hahahahehehahaha!" Selina laughed, squirming underneath Kris' body. Kris pushed up her shirt to better access Selina's flat, tanned belly and kept wiggling her fingers over Selina's belly and inbetweenie navel.

Too soon Kris pulled away and the two women stood up and made their way out of the funhouse. Wow, time really flew by today, Selina thought, looking up at the dark sky. Yes she'd been looking forward to her and Kris' date but she hadn't expected to have so much fun or be able to tickle and get tickled so much.

Selina didn't feel ready to leave yet and luckily she noticed that the crowds of people at the amusement park were gathering on a field near the rides to watch a fireworks show. She and Kris followed and found a spot on a hill where they could sit together. As the fireworks started bursting across the sky Selina turned to Kris and said, "I had a lot of fun today."

Kris smiled back at her. "Me too." Looking a little nervous the other woman leaned in, and Selina closed her eyes and met her in the middle. Their lips pressed together and Selina felt a burst of happiness flow through her. Hopefully she and Kris would be able to have even more equally exciting -and belly and belly button filled dates in the future.
